NFL Network's Adam Rank joins Harmon for the first half of the show to provide predictions Super Bowl LX. Rank and Harmon also discuss the Chicago Bears magical season and who could be 'next year's Bears' and take a massive leap offensively.

To end the show, we share Harmon's interviews with CeeDee Lamb, Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey.",
