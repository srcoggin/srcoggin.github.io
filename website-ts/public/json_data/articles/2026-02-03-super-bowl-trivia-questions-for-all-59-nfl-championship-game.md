With the Super Bowl’s stage set once again as the NFL’s biggest annual crossroads of history, hype and hard outcomes, CBS Sports is leaning into the league’s long memory by rolling out a sprawling set of Super Bowl trivia questions designed to test — and often trip up — even the most devoted fans. The feature, framed as “questions for all 59 NFL championship games,” arrives at a time when the Super Bowl has grown beyond a single game into a cultural checkpoint, and when leaguewide attention routinely turns to what fans remember as much as what teams will do next.

CBS Sports’ NFL coverage billed the project as “Super Bowl trivia: Questions for all 59 NFL championship games that will stump even the savviest football fans,” presenting it as a comprehensive challenge tied to pro football’s premier event. The aim is straightforward, according to the site’s description: “Put your knowledge about pro football’s greatest game to the test.” But the timing and scope underline something larger. With 59 championship games worth of details, oddities and turning points now packed into the Super Bowl’s record book, the league’s signature night has become a living archive — one where legacies are made in bursts of a few plays and where even widely watched moments can blur as new seasons stack on top of old ones.

The format also speaks to how the Super Bowl functions in the modern NFL calendar. The championship game is both an endpoint and a starting line: It closes the season, but it also sets storylines that linger into the offseason, shaping how fan bases talk about quarterbacks, coaches and franchises. A trivia project spanning every Super Bowl invites fans to revisit the smallest identifiers of those storylines — the names, circumstances and game-specific facts that define how each championship is remembered.

For casual viewers, the challenge doubles as a guided tour through Super Bowl history, connecting generations of fans to the breadth of the event’s footprint. For long-time followers, it’s a reminder that the NFL’s most famous game is not just about the handful of iconic highlights replayed every year, but also the granular details that separate one championship from the next.

As the league marches toward its next title game, the CBS Sports package offers a different kind of pregame ritual: a look back at the 59 Super Bowls already played, and an implicit question about the next one. The outcome will add another chapter to the NFL’s biggest night — and, inevitably, another set of facts that future fans will be challenged to recall.With the Super Bowl’s stage set once again as the NFL’s biggest annual crossroads of history, hype and hard outcomes, CBS Sports is leaning into the league’s long memory by rolling out a sprawling set of Super Bowl trivia questions designed to test — and often trip up — even the most devoted fans.
