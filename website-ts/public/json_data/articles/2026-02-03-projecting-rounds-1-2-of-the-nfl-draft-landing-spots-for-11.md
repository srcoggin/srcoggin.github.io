Matt Miller’s latest two-round NFL mock draft for ESPN underscores a familiar league reality: The Senior Bowl can move prospects up boards in a hurry, but it does not automatically create a quarterback rush. Even after a week in Mobile that helped elevate 11 standouts in Miller’s projection of Rounds 1-2, he forecast only two quarterbacks coming off the board in the first two rounds — a notable signal in a league where quarterback need often drives the entire top of the draft.

Miller’s exercise goes two rounds deep and centers on “landing spots” for those Senior Bowl risers, reflecting how the all-star showcase has become a key checkpoint between the end of the college season and April’s draft. With coaching staffs and front offices descending on practices, the week is often less about the game and more about how prospects handle pro-style installs, one-on-one matchups and constant evaluation. In a class with plenty of roster-help options, Miller’s mock highlights how strong performances in Mobile can sharpen a team’s vision for addressing immediate needs at premium positions.

The most striking takeaway, though, is what didn’t happen in Miller’s projection: a sweeping run on passers. Quarterbacks typically get pulled up the board by scarcity and urgency, but Miller’s two-round map suggests teams may be more inclined — at least in his read of the class and the market — to fill foundational holes elsewhere early, then attack quarterback through other avenues or later in the draft. That matters for franchises facing long-term uncertainty behind center, as well as for clubs with established starters that could prioritize protection, pass rush and playmakers after evaluating the Senior Bowl crop.

Miller’s mock also illustrates the Senior Bowl’s role as a separator for non-quarterbacks. A productive week in Mobile can clarify a player’s positional versatility, expose polish against better competition and provide evaluators with cleaner comparisons than many prospects get in their college conferences. In a two-round projection, those gains can translate into a full-round swing — the difference between a team picking a player as a potential Year 1 contributor or waiting and hoping he lasts.

With the draft still ahead, the broader implication is that roster-building pressure may shape Round 1 and early Round 2 more than a scramble for quarterbacks. As the process continues through medical evaluations, interviews and pro days, Miller’s projection offers an early warning for quarterback-needy teams: If only two passers are expected in the first two rounds, the remaining options could create difficult decisions — either to reach, trade, or pivot — when the draft clock starts.Matt Miller’s latest two-round NFL mock draft for ESPN underscores a familiar league reality: The Senior Bowl can move prospects up boards in a hurry, but it does not automatically create a quarterback rush.
