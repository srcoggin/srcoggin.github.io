Rams coach Sean McVay is publicly keeping the door open for Matthew Stafford’s return — and doing it in a way that underscores just how consequential the quarterback’s decision could be for Los Angeles heading into 2026.

Speaking about Stafford’s future, McVay said he is “fingers crossed” that the veteran returns to the Rams in 2026, according to CBS Sports NFL. Stafford has not declared whether he intends to play another season, leaving the franchise’s short- and long-term planning tethered to a decision that remains unresolved.

McVay’s comments highlight the reality for a team that has ridden Stafford’s arm through its most successful recent stretch. Stafford, a longtime NFL starter and Super Bowl-winning quarterback with the Rams, has been the centerpiece of the club’s offense since arriving in Los Angeles. That makes his looming choice more than a routine offseason storyline: It affects the Rams’ roster construction, coaching priorities and the overall trajectory of a team that has been built to compete with a proven veteran leading the huddle.

For McVay, who has long been closely associated with high-level quarterback play and offensive adaptability, Stafford’s status is the single biggest question that hangs over the organization as it looks ahead. The “fingers crossed” remark, while brief, signals both desire and uncertainty — a coach hoping for continuity while acknowledging that the decision ultimately rests with the player.

Stafford’s lack of a public declaration also leaves the Rams in a holding pattern when it comes to contingency planning. If Stafford returns, Los Angeles can build around a known commodity at the sport’s most important position. If he does not, the Rams would face a major pivot, with the franchise needing to identify and develop — or acquire — an answer at quarterback while balancing the expectations that come with having a win-now head coach and a fan base accustomed to big swings.

The significance for NFL fans extends beyond Southern California. Stafford’s decision could ripple through the league’s quarterback marketplace, influencing which teams consider veteran options, how front offices approach the draft and how coaching staffs shape their schemes around either an established passer or a developing one.

For now, the Rams wait. The next clear signal will come when Stafford either commits to another season or indicates he is stepping away, a decision that will define Los Angeles’ outlook and set the tone for McVay’s plans entering 2026.Rams coach Sean McVay is publicly keeping the door open for Matthew Stafford’s return — and doing it in a way that underscores just how consequential the quarterback’s decision could be for Los Angeles heading into 2026.
