The New York Jets’ search for a new offensive coordinator is moving into a more serious phase this week, with Greg Roman set for an in-person interview that could shape how the franchise tries to climb out of another disappointing offensive season.

According to Pro Football Talk, Roman is scheduled to meet face-to-face with the Jets as the team continues its process to fill the vacancy created when it fired offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand last week. The move opened a prominent role on a staff that will be judged heavily by how quickly it can stabilize an offense that has struggled to find consistency and identity.

Roman’s candidacy is notable because an in-person interview typically signals a deeper level of mutual interest and a step forward from preliminary outreach. For a Jets team looking for a coordinator capable of installing structure and producing results quickly, the coming days could provide clarity on whether Roman is the preferred fit or simply part of a wider net.

The opening itself came abruptly. The Jets dismissed Engstrand last week, creating immediate questions about what direction the team wants to take on offense — scheme, play-calling philosophy and staffing priorities. Coordinator searches often reflect broader organizational goals, whether that means leaning into a specific style of attack, tailoring the offense around the roster’s strengths, or ensuring alignment with the head coach’s vision. An experienced candidate such as Roman can represent a desire for a defined system and a clear plan.

The stakes are high because coordinator hires often carry consequences beyond Sundays. Offensive design influences player development, dictates how a team allocates resources and can affect roster decisions from free agency through the draft. For fans, the coordinator selection is frequently a preview of what the franchise believes it can be in the short term — and how quickly it thinks it can get there.

For now, the Jets’ next steps are straightforward: conduct interviews, narrow the field and identify a coordinator who can lead a turnaround. Roman’s in-person meeting will be one of the key checkpoints in that process, with the outcome likely to set the tone for the rest of the offseason.The New York Jets’ search for a new offensive coordinator is moving into a more serious phase this week, with Greg Roman set for an in-person interview that could shape how the franchise tries to climb out of another disappointing offensive season.
