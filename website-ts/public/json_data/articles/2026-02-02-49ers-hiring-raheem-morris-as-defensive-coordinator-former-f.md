The San Francisco 49ers are turning to a familiar voice to lead their defense, hiring Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator, according to CBS Sports NFL. Morris, a former Atlanta Falcons coach, will replace Robert Saleh and reunite with head coach Kyle Shanahan in a move that signals continuity for a team intent on keeping its defensive identity intact.

Morris’ hiring addresses one of the most significant offseason questions for San Francisco: how to maintain stability after a coordinator change. Saleh’s departure left the 49ers needing a new architect for a unit that has been central to the club’s approach under Shanahan. By bringing in Morris — who has prior ties to Shanahan and experience running an NFL team — San Francisco is opting for a coordinator with both scheme familiarity and a broader coaching résumé than many first-time candidates.

CBS Sports noted that Morris “rejoins Kyle Shanahan in the Bay Area,” underscoring a relationship that can streamline the transition. In an NFL where coordinator turnover often leads to wholesale shifts in philosophy, the 49ers’ decision suggests an emphasis on minimizing learning curves and keeping defensive principles consistent from offseason workouts through the regular season.

Morris arrives with high-profile experience as a head coach, most recently in Atlanta, where he served as the Falcons’ coach. That background matters in a coordinator role that often extends beyond play-calling. Defensive coordinators are typically tasked with overseeing game planning, player development and in-game adjustments, while also serving as a key voice in staff meetings and sideline management. Morris’ history running an entire team adds another layer of leadership to Shanahan’s staff.

For 49ers fans, the significance goes beyond a simple staffing update. Defensive coordinators shape how stars are deployed, which matchups are prioritized and how a team responds when opponents exploit weaknesses. A trusted assistant with head-coaching experience can also provide Shanahan with a seasoned partner in weekly preparation and critical moments during games.

The next steps will come quickly. Morris will be charged with implementing his version of the 49ers’ defense, assembling his staff and setting expectations during the offseason program, all while bridging any gaps left by Saleh’s exit. How seamlessly Morris reconnects with Shanahan and molds the unit will be among the defining storylines to watch as San Francisco prepares for its next season.The San Francisco 49ers are turning to a familiar voice to lead their defense, hiring Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator, according to CBS Sports NFL.
