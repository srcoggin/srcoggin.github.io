The Denver Broncos moved quickly to stabilize one of the most important positions on Sean Payton’s staff, reaching agreement with assistant coach Davis Webb to become the team’s offensive coordinator, according to ESPN. The promotion fills a key vacancy and signals continuity for an offense that will be under heavy scrutiny heading into the next phase of Payton’s rebuild.

Webb’s elevation is a notable step for a coach who has been on Denver’s staff and is now being tasked with coordinating the unit most closely tied to the franchise’s immediate direction. Offensive coordinator is one of the NFL’s most influential roles, shaping weekly game plans, determining how quarterbacks are developed and deployed, and ultimately serving as a leading indicator for whether a team is trending toward contention or recalibration. For a Broncos organization trying to find sustained footing, the choice of coordinator carries outsized importance.

According to ESPN’s report, Webb had been an assistant coach with the Broncos before reaching an agreement to take over as offensive coordinator. The move resolves an open spot on Payton’s staff and provides clarity for players entering the offseason program. With the offense’s structure and terminology likely to be central to any progress, settling the coordinator position now gives Denver a defined voice and set of priorities leading into roster decisions and preparation for the 2026 season.

The decision also underscores Payton’s preference for staff cohesion. Promoting from within reduces the learning curve that can come with an outside hire and can help maintain continuity in teaching and evaluation. In the modern NFL, where offensive identities can change dramatically with coordinator turnover, Denver’s move to elevate Webb suggests a desire to build on existing work rather than start over with a new system.

For fans, the impact will be measured in more than play-calling. The offensive coordinator typically plays a major role in quarterback development and in tailoring the scheme to the personnel on hand — areas that can define a team’s competitive ceiling. Webb’s agreement to take the role puts him at the center of Denver’s most consequential football decisions, from shaping weekly plans to helping determine what kinds of players fit best as the Broncos continue to build their roster.

What comes next will be closely watched: how Payton and Webb define the offensive philosophy, how responsibilities are divided on the staff, and how quickly the unit shows cohesion once on-field work begins. In Denver, coordinator hires are never just staff moves — they are statements about the franchise’s direction — and Webb now owns a significant part of the Broncos’ next chapter.The Denver Broncos moved quickly to stabilize one of the most important positions on Sean Payton’s staff, reaching agreement with assistant coach Davis Webb to become the team’s offensive coordinator, according to ESPN.
