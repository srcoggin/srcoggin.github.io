With Super Bowl 60 between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks just days away, the NFL’s offseason machinery is already beginning to turn for the other 30 franchises. While the champion has yet to be crowned, the draft order for the non-playoff teams is officially set, prompting the release of the first comprehensive mock drafts from Yahoo Sports experts. The consensus at the top of the board suggests a changing of the guard for one AFC West franchise, with the Las Vegas Raiders projected to control the draft's narrative.

According to the latest projections, the Raiders are expected to use the first overall pick to select Texas quarterback Arch Manning. After a tumultuous 2025 season that saw Las Vegas finish with the league's worst record, the organization is desperate for stability under center. Manning, who has impressed scouts with his processing speed and pedigree during his tenure with the Longhorns, is viewed as the "safest" franchise cornerstone in a class rich with offensive talent. Analysts note that Manning's ability to operate within a structured offense makes him an ideal fit for the Raiders' current scheme, potentially solving a quarterback carousel that has plagued the team for years.

Following the Raiders, the New York Giants are projected to select second overall, with experts linking them to Missouri wide receiver Luther Burden III. The Giants, looking to add explosive playmaking ability to an offense that stagnated near the bottom of the league rankings, would acquire a versatile weapon capable of lining up in the slot or out wide. The top five is rounded out by a run on defensive linemen, with the Tennessee Titans heavily favored to take Georgia edge rusher Mykel Williams at number three to bolster their pass rush.

The mock draft also sheds light on the strategies of the Super Bowl contenders, who will pick 31st and 32nd. Regardless of Sunday's outcome, both the Patriots and Seahawks are projected to target offensive line depth, capitalizing on what scouts are calling one of the deepest tackle classes in recent memory. For New England, protecting their franchise quarterback remains a long-term priority, while Seattle looks to maintain the physicality that powered their run to the NFC Championship.

As the NFL Scouting Combine approaches in Indianapolis later this month, these projections will undoubtedly shift based on medicals and athletic testing. However, the initial blueprint for the 2026 NFL Draft is clear: it is an offense-driven class at the top, and the Las Vegas Raiders are on the clock to make the decision that will define their next decade.
