Cardi B’s celebrity reach has rarely needed an assist, but with Super Bowl 60 approaching, the rapper’s newest stage is coming from an unexpected place: Patriots fandom. CBS Sports reported that Cardi B is preparing to root for Stefon Diggs and New England in Super Bowl 60, a development that has quickly turned into a talking point around the league as the Patriots head into the sport’s biggest week with an extra spotlight trained on their fan base.

According to CBS Sports, the story is less about a fleeting bandwagon jump and more about how Cardi B became “a massive football fan” and, now, New England’s newest high-profile supporter. The outlet framed her as a “Patriots superfan,” detailing her career rise and emphasizing that her enthusiasm is set to be on full display as she cheers for the Patriots and Diggs on Super Bowl Sunday.

The timing matters. Super Bowl week is often as much about cultural gravity as it is about matchups, and celebrity fandom can amplify a team’s visibility well beyond traditional football audiences. For the Patriots — a franchise long associated with national attention — the addition of a megastar fan arrives as the team prepares for a championship stage where every storyline competes for oxygen, from star players and coaching decisions to the league’s broader entertainment ecosystem.

Diggs’ presence in this narrative is central, with CBS Sports noting Cardi B’s readiness to “root for Stefon Diggs and New England.” In a Super Bowl setting, star receivers can become the face of a game plan, and a marquee name linked to the Patriots’ offensive identity only increases the scrutiny and interest around how New England plans to attack.

CBS Sports’ focus on Cardi B’s background underscores why the league and its partners value these moments: the NFL’s biggest game is also its biggest platform, and crossover appeal can deepen engagement. The Patriots already carry a brand recognized across the sport; a celebrity superfan can help tilt casual attention into sustained interest, particularly among viewers drawn in by pop culture as much as by X’s and O’s.

As kickoff nears, the Patriots’ most important work remains on the field, but Super Bowl week rarely stays confined between the lines. With Cardi B publicly aligning herself with New England and Diggs, one more storyline will track alongside the usual game-day questions — and it will be worth watching how loudly that new corner of the Patriots’ fan base shows up when Super Bowl 60 arrives.Cardi B’s celebrity reach has rarely needed an assist, but with Super Bowl 60 approaching, the rapper’s newest stage is coming from an unexpected place: Patriots fandom.
