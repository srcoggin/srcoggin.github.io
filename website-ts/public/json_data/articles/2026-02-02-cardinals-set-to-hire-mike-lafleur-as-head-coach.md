The Arizona Cardinals are set to hire Mike LaFleur as their next head coach, turning to a play-caller with recent experience running one of the league’s more visible offenses and signaling a clear commitment to an attack-minded reset. The move, first reported by Yahoo Sports NFL and also noted by Pro Football Talk, positions the franchise to build around a coach who has spent the last three seasons coordinating the Los Angeles Rams’ offense.

LaFleur’s hiring also brings an immediate storyline: He is the younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur. The family connection is notable not just for headlines, but for what it suggests about coaching lineage and shared philosophies that have been prevalent across the NFL in recent years, where offensive systems and staff trees often spread quickly from one organization to another.

Arizona’s decision to hand the job to Mike LaFleur underscores the premium teams continue to place on offensive continuity and quarterback-friendly structure. As the Rams’ offensive coordinator for the past three seasons, LaFleur operated within one of the league’s most scrutinized environments, where weekly game plans and adjustments are dissected in real time. That experience will now be central as he takes over a Cardinals team looking for a clearer identity and sustained traction in a competitive NFC landscape.

While the reports did not include contract terms or an official announcement timeline, the “set to hire” framing from both outlets indicates the process is nearing completion. The Cardinals will now pivot to the next phase of the coaching transition, with LaFleur expected to shape his staff and implement his system. Those choices will matter immediately, particularly on offense, where scheme fit and terminology can influence personnel decisions and offseason priorities.

The significance for NFL fans goes beyond Arizona. Another LaFleur on the head-coaching circuit adds to a continuing leaguewide trend: franchises prioritizing coaches with play-calling backgrounds and recent coordinator experience, especially those tied to established offensive ecosystems.

The next steps will come quickly. Once the hire is finalized, attention will shift to whom LaFleur brings with him, how closely his Cardinals offense mirrors what he coordinated with the Rams, and how swiftly Arizona can translate a coaching change into measurable progress.The Arizona Cardinals are set to hire Mike LaFleur as their next head coach, turning to a play-caller with recent experience running one of the league’s more visible offenses and signaling a clear commitment to an attack-minded reset.
