The Dallas Cowboys’ 2026 offseason is shaping up to be defined not just by star power, but by a position group that can dictate everything from the run game to the quarterback’s health: offensive tackle. According to Yahoo Sports’ NFL offseason preview focusing on the team’s tackles, Dallas has “some decisions to make at tackle this offseason,” a reality that puts a premium on roster planning at one of football’s most expensive and difficult-to-fill positions.

In the modern NFL, tackle play is often the foundation of an offense, with the best edge rushers living on the outside and defensive coordinators building pressure packages to test protections. For the Cowboys, that makes the tackle conversation more than a depth-chart exercise. It touches scheme flexibility, weekly matchup planning and the team’s ability to function efficiently over a full season. If the edges are unsettled, the rest of the offense — from the timing of the passing game to the consistency of the rushing attack — can become fragile.

Yahoo Sports’ preview frames the situation simply and starkly: Dallas has work to do. The Cowboys must evaluate their current options and decide whether the answers are already on the roster, whether they need to invest in replacements, or whether a reshuffling is required. Those decisions rarely happen in isolation. Tackle choices can affect how a team allocates resources across the offensive line, whether it prioritizes interior reinforcement, and how it approaches contract planning and overall roster construction.

The significance for fans is straightforward: few positions swing a season more quietly than tackle. A dependable pair can stabilize an offense even amid injuries elsewhere, while uncertainty can ripple across the unit and force adjustments that show up on Sundays — tighter play-calling, more help from tight ends and backs, and less room for error against elite defensive fronts.

The coming months will put Dallas’ front office and coaching staff under a familiar spotlight, as the Cowboys weigh short-term security against long-term stability. With the Yahoo Sports preview underscoring looming decisions at offensive tackle, the key question is how aggressively Dallas responds — and whether those choices set the tone for an offseason aimed at building an offense sturdy enough to withstand the NFL’s relentless edge pressure.The Dallas Cowboys’ 2026 offseason is shaping up to be defined not just by star power, but by a position group that can dictate everything from the run game to the quarterback’s health: offensive tackle.
