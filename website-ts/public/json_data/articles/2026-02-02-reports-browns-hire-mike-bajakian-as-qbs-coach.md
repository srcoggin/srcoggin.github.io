The Browns continued to round out Todd Monken’s offensive staff with a familiar lieutenant, hiring Mike Bajakian as quarterbacks coach, according to multiple reports cited by Pro Football Talk. The move ties Cleveland’s most important developmental role — overseeing the quarterback room — directly to Monken’s vision, a notable step for an offense that will be judged heavily by its quarterback play in 2025.

Bajakian is “following Todd Monken to the Browns,” Pro Football Talk reported, signaling that Cleveland’s new offensive direction is being built with coaches who already share terminology, teaching methods and expectations. Quarterbacks coaching is among the most scrutinized jobs on any NFL staff, and the Browns’ decision to pair Monken with a trusted aide underscores the franchise’s intent to streamline communication and accelerate installation as the offseason program approaches.

The hire also provides an early indicator of how Monken plans to structure his offense in Cleveland. While coordinators set scheme and weekly plans, the quarterbacks coach typically handles daily mechanics, footwork and decision-making work while also serving as a key conduit between the quarterback and the play-caller. When that role is filled by a coach with an established background with the coordinator, teams often view it as a way to reduce translation issues that can crop up in a new system — especially in the early months of a staff transition.

For Browns fans, the significance is straightforward: Cleveland is placing a premium on continuity within a new coaching setup, particularly at the position that most directly determines offensive ceiling and week-to-week consistency. Bajakian’s arrival gives Monken a familiar voice in the meeting room and on the practice field, a factor that can matter when new language, new progressions and new timing are being installed.

Cleveland’s staff-building process will continue in the weeks ahead, but the addition of Bajakian marks a clear through-line in Monken’s early tenure. As the Browns turn toward offseason work, the quarterback room will be one of the primary focal points — not only for how quickly the offense comes together, but for how effectively it translates to Sundays once the regular season arrives.The Browns continued to round out Todd Monken’s offensive staff with a familiar lieutenant, hiring Mike Bajakian as quarterbacks coach, according to multiple reports cited by Pro Football Talk.
