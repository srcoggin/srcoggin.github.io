The Atlanta Falcons are set to make a notable addition to their offensive staff, hiring veteran coach Alex Van Pelt as quarterbacks coach, according to Pro Football Talk. The move is significant for a franchise that has been searching for stability and development at the game’s most important position, and it adds an experienced hand to an operation trying to push its offense forward.

Pro Football Talk reported the hire under the headline “Falcons to hire Alex Van Pelt as QB coach,” framing it as the latest staff move connected to Kevin Stefanski. “Kevin Stefanski has made another addition to his coaching staff in Atlanta,” the outlet wrote, underscoring the continuing churn and cross-pollination that often characterizes NFL coaching cycles. While details on Van Pelt’s exact responsibilities beyond the quarterbacks room were not included in the report, the title alone signals a direct influence on how Atlanta prepares, teaches and tailors the passing game for its starter and depth chart.

Quarterbacks coaches are typically central figures in weekly game-planning and day-to-day fundamentals, serving as the primary conduit between the offensive coordinator’s vision and the quarterback’s execution. For the Falcons, that makes the decision consequential not just for Sundays, but for the entire developmental arc of the position — from offseason installation to in-season adjustments.

The hire also reflects the premium teams place on staff experience, particularly in a league where quarterback play can swing a season. Even for casual fans, the importance is straightforward: quarterbacks are the engine of most modern offenses, and the coach charged with shaping their footwork, timing, coverage recognition and situational decision-making can be a hidden driver behind a team’s ceiling.

Atlanta’s decision to bring in Van Pelt suggests an intent to reinforce that infrastructure with a coach who has been around the league long enough to bring perspective and routine to a demanding job. It also signals that the Falcons’ staff-building remains active as they finalize roles that can have an outsized effect on offensive consistency.

The next step will be seeing how quickly Van Pelt meshes with Atlanta’s broader offensive approach and how the quarterbacks respond once on-field work ramps up. For NFL fans, the early tells will come in camp usage, communication on the sideline and — most importantly — whether Atlanta’s quarterback play looks more decisive and connected to the scheme when the regular season arrives.The Atlanta Falcons are set to make a notable addition to their offensive staff, hiring veteran coach Alex Van Pelt as quarterbacks coach, according to Pro Football Talk.
