Sean McVay delivered a clear message about one of the biggest questions hovering over his roster beyond this season, saying he is “absolutely” expecting Davante Adams to be back in 2026. The comment, reported by Pro Football Talk, offered a rare piece of certainty in a moment when the Rams’ broader offensive picture includes far less clarity — most notably surrounding veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford as he approaches another career crossroads.

Stafford is about to turn 38 this month after completing his 17th NFL season, and the veteran may need time to decide on his professional future, according to Pro Football Talk. That timeline matters for the Rams, who have built around Stafford’s ability to run McVay’s system and push the ball down the field. It also matters for Adams, a marquee receiver whose presence would shape any short- and long-term planning at quarterback and across the offense.

McVay’s confidence about Adams’ 2026 status stands out precisely because the Rams are operating in an NFL reality where roster continuity is often fleeting. When a coach publicly speaks in definitive terms about a star player’s return two years out, it signals both the organization’s expectations and a desire to project stability to a locker room and fan base that understand how quickly circumstances can change — especially at quarterback.

For readers less familiar with the situation, Stafford has been one of the league’s longest-tenured quarterbacks, and the end of a 17th season is typically an inflection point. The physical toll, recovery timelines and appetite for another offseason program all factor into a decision that rarely hinges on one issue alone. McVay’s offense, however, is heavily quarterback-dependent, and any uncertainty at the position has a ripple effect for everyone around it, including high-profile skill players.

Adams’ projected return in 2026 also carries organizational implications. Even without contract specifics in the available reporting, high-end receiving talent is among the league’s most valuable commodities, and retaining it can influence everything from offseason priorities to how aggressively a team pursues short-term solutions if a quarterback decision drags into the spring or summer.

For now, the Rams’ coaching staff appears to be projecting confidence in its perimeter firepower while waiting on a more delicate answer at the most important position. The immediate watch point is Stafford’s timeline and whether his decision arrives early enough to shape offseason planning — or late enough to force the Rams into contingency mode even as McVay publicly plants a flag on Adams being part of the 2026 picture.Sean McVay delivered a clear message about one of the biggest questions hovering over his roster beyond this season, saying he is “absolutely” expecting Davante Adams to be back in 2026.
