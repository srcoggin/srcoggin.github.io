The Tennessee Titans are expected to hire Gus Bradley as their next defensive coordinator, a move that reshapes the club’s coaching staff and clarifies one of the more closely watched coordinator markets of the offseason. The development also closes the door on speculation elsewhere: Bradley will not be the next defensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, according to Yahoo Sports NFL.

For Tennessee, bringing in Bradley signals a clear direction on the defensive side of the ball. Defensive coordinators set the identity, terminology and weekly game plans that can define a team as much as its head coach and quarterback. The Titans have been searching for stability and production on defense, and the hire indicates the organization is turning to an experienced coach to run the unit.

Bradley has been a prominent name in NFL coaching circles for years, most notably as a defensive-minded coach who has led multiple NFL defenses and coordinated game plans around the league. Tennessee’s decision to move toward hiring him suggests the franchise is prioritizing a veteran play-caller and a system with an established track record, even as rosters and staff continue to be adjusted across the AFC.

The report is notable beyond Nashville because it also impacts Arizona’s staff-building process. Yahoo Sports noted that Bradley will not be the next defensive coordinator of the Cardinals, removing him from consideration as the team continues its search. Coordinator hires often have ripple effects, with one team’s decision accelerating another’s timeline or narrowing candidate pools across the league.

While the source material did not include contract terms, official announcements or statements from either organization, the expectation of Bradley’s arrival provides immediate clarity for Tennessee’s offseason planning. A defensive coordinator typically has significant input on scheme fits, position coaching alignments and how personnel is deployed, which can influence everything from free-agent targets to draft priorities and offseason program emphasis.

The next step to watch will be whether the Titans formally announce the hire and how the rest of the defensive staff is shaped around Bradley. For the Cardinals, the focus shifts to alternative candidates as the club continues to fill out its coaching staff. As the NFL coaching carousel slows, coordinator decisions like this can have outsized impact, setting a team’s approach on one side of the ball for years and shaping how quickly it can compete in a crowded conference.The Tennessee Titans are expected to hire Gus Bradley as their next defensive coordinator, a move that reshapes the club’s coaching staff and clarifies one of the more closely watched coordinator markets of the offseason.
