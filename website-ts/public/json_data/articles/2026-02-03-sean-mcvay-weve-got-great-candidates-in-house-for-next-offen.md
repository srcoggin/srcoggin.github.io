The Los Angeles Rams are entering another offseason of change on Sean McVay’s staff, this time with the added sting of losing a key assistant to a division rival. After the Arizona Cardinals hired Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur as their head coach over the weekend, McVay acknowledged the vacancy but signaled the organization is prepared to keep its offensive identity intact.

“We’ve got great candidates in-house for next offensive coordinator,” McVay said, according to Pro Football Talk, underscoring a familiar Rams approach: promoting from within rather than chasing splashy outside hires. For a franchise that has built much of its recent success on continuity in scheme and coaching voice, the next hire will be closely watched across the NFC West.

LaFleur’s exit creates an immediate practical challenge for McVay, who calls plays and remains the central architect of the Rams offense. The offensive coordinator job in Los Angeles still carries significant influence, from weekly game-planning and installation to quarterback development and staff management. With a head coach so closely tied to the offense, the coordinator’s ability to translate McVay’s vision through the position rooms and into game-day preparation can be as important as the name on the play sheet.

The move also sharpens the divisional intrigue. Arizona not only plucked a top assistant from a rival but installed him as the face of its franchise. For the Rams, it means preparing to face an opponent led by a coach with firsthand knowledge of McVay’s system, terminology and weekly processes — a dynamic that often adds another layer to divisional matchups.

McVay’s public emphasis on internal candidates suggests the Rams believe their best answers are already in the building. That continuity could matter in the early portion of the offseason program, when offenses install foundational concepts and coaches set expectations for how the unit will operate. Promoting from within can also limit disruption for players accustomed to a specific structure, particularly in a scheme driven by timing, detail and repetition.

The coming weeks will reveal how McVay balances familiarity with fresh ideas as he fills a high-profile spot on his staff. Whether the Rams elevate an assistant or reshuffle responsibilities, the decision will shape offseason planning — and potentially the next chapter of the NFC West rivalry with a Cardinals team now led by the Rams’ former coordinator.The Los Angeles Rams are entering another offseason of change on Sean McVay’s staff, this time with the added sting of losing a key assistant to a division rival.
