CBS Sports rolled out an early betting blueprint for Super Bowl 60, spotlighting a hypothetical Patriots-Seahawks matchup and a sprawling menu of proposition wagers that underscore how far the NFL’s biggest game has expanded beyond the final score. The outlet’s “props guide” frames the event around odds, picks and trends tied to players, scoring, the MVP race and even novelty markets such as the coin toss, reflecting the growing slice of Super Bowl attention that now revolves around micro-outcomes as much as the Lombardi Trophy itself.

The guide centers on Super Bowl 2026 props involving New England and Seattle, presenting what CBS Sports described as the “best bets” across several of the most popular categories. While a traditional point spread and total typically anchor Super Bowl wagering, prop markets have increasingly become the main attraction for casual and experienced bettors alike, in part because they offer multiple ways to engage with the game even if the winner is uncertain. CBS Sports’ package emphasizes that breadth, with props spanning in-game production by individual players, scoring-related outcomes, the MVP selection and the ceremonial coin toss.

By focusing on Patriots vs. Seahawks, the guide also taps into the NFL’s constant churn of storylines, where Super Bowl projections and betting interest can accelerate long before the season’s defining moments arrive. Props tied to MVP, for example, draw attention because they compress the narrative of a championship game into a single award decision, often influenced by game script and position value. Player props, meanwhile, turn individual usage and efficiency into headline outcomes, while scoring props allow bettors to wager on how points are produced rather than simply how many are scored.

CBS Sports’ roundup illustrates how the Super Bowl has become a weeklong ecosystem of markets and trends, with the coin toss remaining one of the most accessible, high-visibility novelty bets. Those lighter wagers coexist with more traditional football-centric questions — which players produce, how scoring unfolds, and who is most likely to leave the field as MVP — creating an entry point for fans who want deeper layers of engagement on top of the game itself.

The broader implication for NFL fans is that Super Bowl coverage now routinely includes wagering analysis as a parallel track to team-building and matchup breakdowns. With CBS Sports positioning its guide as an all-in-one primer on props, the lead-up to Super Bowl 60 figures to feature the usual football questions — and a steady drumbeat of prop-driven conversation that can shift quickly as rosters, health and public sentiment evolve. As the season advances, the markets highlighted in the guide are likely to change with every major injury update, breakout performance and playoff result, keeping Patriots-Seahawks — and the prop universe around it — in motion.CBS Sports rolled out an early betting blueprint for Super Bowl 60, spotlighting a hypothetical Patriots-Seahawks matchup and a sprawling menu of proposition wagers that underscore how far the NFL’s biggest game has expanded beyond the final score.
