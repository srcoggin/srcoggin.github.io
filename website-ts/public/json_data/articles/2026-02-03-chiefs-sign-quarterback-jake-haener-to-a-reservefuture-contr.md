The Kansas City Chiefs took an early step toward reshaping their offseason quarterback room by signing Jake Haener to a reserve/future contract, a move that underscores how unsettled the depth chart behind Patrick Mahomes can be this time of year.

Yahoo Sports NFL reported the Chiefs added Haener on a reserve/future deal, a standard type of contract used at the end of the season to secure a player’s rights for the upcoming offseason program and training camp. Those agreements rarely guarantee anything beyond a chance to compete, but they can be meaningful for a team like Kansas City that often treats the backup quarterback role as a year-to-year puzzle — especially in a league where roster flexibility matters as much as star power.

The addition of Haener signals that the Chiefs are continuing to churn options behind Mahomes rather than locking into a single plan months ahead of Week 1. The report described Kansas City’s offseason quarterback situation as likely to “remain fluid,” an acknowledgment that the team’s decision-makers can use the spring and summer to sort out competition and fit, not only at quarterback but across the roster as a whole.

For fans, the significance is less about challenging Mahomes — the face of the franchise and centerpiece of Kansas City’s Super Bowl expectations — and more about protecting the most important position in sports with reliable depth. Teams routinely cycle through quarterbacks in the offseason, bringing in arms for practices, preseason games and camp competitions while weighing who best fits the offensive system and game-day needs.

Reserve/future signings also reflect the Chiefs’ broader approach to roster-building: secure developmental players early, then reassess after the wave of free agency, the draft and post-draft signings. The quarterback position, in particular, can evolve quickly as veterans hit the market, draft picks become available, and other teams’ roster decisions create new opportunities.

Haener’s contract places him into that pipeline. In practical terms, it gives Kansas City another quarterback for the offseason program and training camp while keeping the team’s options open. It also creates another layer of competition in a room where the backup job can have real consequences over a 17-game season.

What comes next will be worth tracking. With the offseason quarterback picture expected to stay fluid, the Chiefs’ depth chart could change again through additional signings, trades or draft decisions. For a team with championship aspirations built around Mahomes, the work behind the scenes — including reserve/future deals like Haener’s — can matter more than it looks in January.The Kansas City Chiefs took an early step toward reshaping their offseason quarterback room by signing Jake Haener to a reserve/future contract, a move that underscores how unsettled the depth chart behind Patrick Mahomes can be this time of year.
