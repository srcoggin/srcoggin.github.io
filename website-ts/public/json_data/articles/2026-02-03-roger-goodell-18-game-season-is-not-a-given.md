NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pushed back Monday on the notion that an 18-game regular season is inevitable, offering a more cautious public posture than a prominent owner who recently suggested the league is headed there.

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said recently that “every team will go to 18” regular-season games at some point in the future. But when Goodell was asked about the idea during a press conference in San Francisco, he indicated that expanding the schedule by another game is “not a given,” according to Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk.

The comments mattered because the NFL’s regular-season format sits at the center of the league’s business model and its labor relationship with players. The league moved to a 17-game season in 2021, a change that added inventory for broadcasters and streaming partners and created an additional week of meaningful games for fans. Any further expansion would again touch nearly every corner of the sport — from competitive balance and player health to the way teams manage rosters over a longer grind.

Goodell’s remarks also underscored that even when influential owners speak confidently about where the league is headed, the commissioner is mindful of the hurdles involved in making such a change. Moving to 18 regular-season games would not simply be a scheduling tweak; it would require agreement between the league and the NFL Players Association as part of the sport’s collective bargaining framework. That reality has loomed over every schedule adjustment in the modern era, with owners weighing the financial upside against the physical toll on players and the NFLPA’s leverage in negotiations.

Kraft’s assertion carried weight because of his standing among owners and his long-term influence in league matters. Yet Goodell’s response in San Francisco suggested the commissioner is not ready to frame 18 games as a foregone conclusion, even as discussions about the league’s future calendar continue in the background.

For fans, the debate is about more than one additional Sunday. A longer regular season could reshape playoff races, alter how teams approach rest and late-season strategy, and further elevate the importance of depth across the roster. It could also intensify scrutiny on player safety in a sport already defined by attrition.

What to watch next is whether league leadership or ownership groups begin to publicly outline the conditions that would have to be met for an 18-game schedule to move from speculation to proposal — and whether Goodell’s “not a given” stance signals caution, negotiation positioning, or both.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pushed back Monday on the notion that an 18-game regular season is inevitable, offering a more cautious public posture than a prominent owner who recently suggested the league is headed there.
