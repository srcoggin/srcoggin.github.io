Super Bowl 60 already has an address, and with it comes the next major waypoint on the NFL calendar: the league’s championship game in 2026 is headed to Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., home of the San Francisco 49ers. The site selection matters well beyond geography. It shapes travel plans for fans, influences a weeklong slate of league and sponsor events, and once again underscores the NFL’s preference for modern venues capable of hosting the sport’s biggest stage.

CBS Sports NFL, in a venue history and location explainer, notes that Super Bowl 60 will be played in the heart of the Bay Area at Levi’s Stadium. The building previously hosted Super Bowl 50, when the Denver Broncos beat the Carolina Panthers, giving the stadium a proven résumé for handling the logistical demands that come with the sport’s marquee event.

The return to Santa Clara puts the Super Bowl back in Northern California a decade after that Broncos-Panthers matchup. Levi’s Stadium, which opened in 2014, has become a regular stop for high-profile NFL events and neutral-site spectacles, a key factor in the league’s ongoing rotation among markets with newer stadiums and extensive surrounding infrastructure. The Super Bowl has evolved into a weeklong festival — a corporate and media hub as much as a game — and the host site must accommodate everything from credentialed media operations to fan events and security perimeters.

For fans, the announcement provides a long runway. Super Bowl locations often become part of the season’s narrative — especially for teams and fan bases that travel well — as postseason hopefuls begin imagining the path to a specific city. The Bay Area, already a central NFL market with deep football roots, will become the league’s focal point as the 2025 season ends and the 2026 postseason ramps up.

The selection also carries leaguewide implications. The Super Bowl is the NFL’s showcase for broadcast partners, sponsors and international audiences, and the venue needs to deliver a television product that matches the event’s scale. Returning to a stadium that has already staged the game reduces uncertainty in planning and execution.

With Super Bowl 60 set for Levi’s Stadium, the NFL’s long view is clear: The league is again pairing its biggest moment with a modern venue and a major market. Fans can now mark Santa Clara as the destination — and keep an eye on how the 2025 season’s contenders position themselves for a shot at a championship in Northern California.Super Bowl 60 already has an address, and with it comes the next major waypoint on the NFL calendar: the league’s championship game in 2026 is headed to Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., home of the San Francisco 49ers.
