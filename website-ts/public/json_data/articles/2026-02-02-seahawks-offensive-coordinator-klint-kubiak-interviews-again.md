Seattle’s offensive staff could be headed for another shake-up, with coordinator Klint Kubiak drawing fresh interest as the NFL’s hiring cycle continues. Kubiak, who is widely expected to leave Seattle after the Super Bowl, interviewed again with the Las Vegas Raiders and the Arizona Cardinals, according to Pro Football Talk — a development that underscores how quickly a deep postseason run can trigger changes on a coaching staff.

The additional interviews signal that Kubiak remains a serious candidate as teams sort through options for key openings. A second meeting typically reflects sustained mutual interest, and in this case it comes at a moment when Seattle’s season is still active, putting the spotlight on how franchises balance immediate competitive goals with the realities of staff turnover.

Kubiak’s situation matters to Seahawks fans because the offensive coordinator role is one of the most consequential positions in any organization, shaping weekly game plans, player usage and overall identity. When a team reaches the sport’s biggest stage, the staff often becomes a target for clubs looking to import successful ideas and leadership. Pro Football Talk reported the Seahawks are “widely expected to lose” Kubiak after the Super Bowl, an expectation reinforced by his continued conversations with other teams.

For Las Vegas and Arizona, the renewed interviews suggest both clubs are keeping their search active and casting a wide net for an offensive-minded voice capable of guiding a franchise. In a league increasingly driven by scheme and quarterback development, coordinators who can present a clear offensive vision often rise quickly on the market.

Seattle, meanwhile, faces the familiar challenge of maintaining continuity while preparing for possible departures. Even the perception of pending change can shape how a team plans ahead — from evaluating assistant coaches internally to anticipating how much of the system can be retained if the coordinator moves on. With Kubiak still in the interview process, Seattle is left in a holding pattern: finishing the season’s most important work while keeping an eye on what could come next on the sideline and in the meeting rooms.

The next major pivot point arrives after the Super Bowl, when teams can finalize staffing decisions and assistants are free to make definitive moves. Until then, Kubiak’s repeated interviews with the Raiders and Cardinals are a reminder that postseason success brings opportunity — and that for contenders, keeping a coaching staff intact can be as challenging as winning in January and February.Seattle’s offensive staff could be headed for another shake-up, with coordinator Klint Kubiak drawing fresh interest as the NFL’s hiring cycle continues.
