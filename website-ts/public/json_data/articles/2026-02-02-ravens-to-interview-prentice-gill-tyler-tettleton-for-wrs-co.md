The Baltimore Ravens have begun shaping the next phase of their offensive staff, identifying two candidates to interview for a key position that could influence the development of their passing game. According to Yahoo Sports NFL, the Ravens plan to interview Prentice Gill and Tyler Tettleton for their vacant wide receivers coach job, a move that underscores the organization’s focus on refining its receiver room and the weekly details that help translate an offensive plan into production on Sundays.

The wide receivers coach role is often one of the most player-facing jobs on an NFL staff, responsible for daily technique work, game-plan-specific adjustments and communication between the receivers and the play-caller. In Baltimore, that position carries added importance because the Ravens’ passing-game identity has long been scrutinized — not only for its design but for how consistently wideouts have developed and performed within it. Interviewing multiple candidates early signals the team is casting a wide net for a teacher and communicator capable of maximizing the group’s skills and fitting within the Ravens’ broader offensive structure.

Yahoo Sports reported the Ravens have “identified two candidates” for the job: Gill and Tettleton. While the report did not specify a timetable for the interviews or what stage of the hiring process the team has reached, the names indicate Baltimore is actively moving to fill a vacancy that touches both player development and in-game execution. For fans, the position matters because the wide receiver group’s week-to-week consistency can affect everything from third-down efficiency to red-zone conversions and late-game comeback potential.

The decision also lands at a time of yearly transition around the league, when teams retool staffs to match evolving roster needs and schematic trends. Even subtle coaching changes can have outsized impact, particularly at a position group where timing, route precision and trust are critical. A wide receivers coach can shape how quickly newcomers acclimate, how veterans adjust to opponent tendencies and how effectively the group works with the quarterback on spacing and reads.

What to watch next will be whether the Ravens expand the interview list beyond Gill and Tettleton, and how quickly the organization moves from interviews to a hire. With Baltimore’s offseason program looming later in the calendar, the next wide receivers coach will be tasked with setting the tone early — installing daily standards and building cohesion that can carry into training camp and, ultimately, the regular season.The Baltimore Ravens have begun shaping the next phase of their offensive staff, identifying two candidates to interview for a key position that could influence the development of their passing game.
