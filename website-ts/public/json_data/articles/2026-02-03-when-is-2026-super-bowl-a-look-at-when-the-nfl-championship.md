Super Bowl plans for the 2025 season now have a date, a venue and, at least in one early projection, a matchup that would carry plenty of NFL history with it.

CBS Sports reported that Super Bowl LX is scheduled to be played at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. The report framed the championship game as a meeting between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, a pairing that would immediately evoke one of the most scrutinized endings in Super Bowl history and put two of the league’s most recognizable brands back on the sport’s biggest stage.

The significance of the date and site goes beyond the calendar. Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, will again serve as the NFL’s showcase venue, positioning the Bay Area at the center of the league’s largest annual event. The Super Bowl is the NFL’s premier television property and a weeklong football festival, and the league’s decision to return to Levi’s underscores the stadium’s place in the rotation of host sites capable of handling the game’s massive operational demands.

For fans, the Feb. 8 date offers a clear endpoint for a season that culminates with the postseason and the Super Bowl, the championship game that decides the league title. For the Seahawks and Patriots — as outlined in the CBS Sports report’s look ahead — the stakes would be obvious: a chance to capture the Lombardi Trophy, the sport’s ultimate prize, in a venue that has previously hosted the event and is designed for major, high-profile spectacles.

The matchup itself would be rich in narrative. Seattle and New England share a Super Bowl legacy that remains part of the NFL’s modern lore, and the possibility of seeing those franchises meet again on the sport’s grandest stage would add another layer of anticipation for fans who remember that era. Even for readers less familiar with the backstory, the franchises’ recent and historical relevance makes the pairing notable, linking one of the NFC’s most identifiable teams with one of the AFC’s most decorated.

The calendar now turns toward how the 2025 season’s playoff chase will actually unfold. With Super Bowl LX set for Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium, the league’s focus will build toward which teams earn the right to play there — and whether the Seahawks-Patriots matchup forecasted by CBS Sports becomes more than a talking point as the season progresses.Super Bowl plans for the 2025 season now have a date, a venue and, at least in one early projection, a matchup that would carry plenty of NFL history with it.
