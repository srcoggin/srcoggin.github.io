Two of the New England Patriots’ top defenders sounded optimistic about suiting up on the sport’s biggest stage, offering encouraging injury updates Tuesday night that could shape the team’s chances in the Super Bowl.

Linebacker Robert Spillane and edge rusher Harold Landry, both dealing with injuries as the Patriots prepare for the championship game, spoke during Super Bowl media night and indicated they are targeting a return. Their availability matters for a New England defense that has leaned on physicality and pressure to carry long stretches of games — and that now faces the steepest test of the season with a title on the line.

Spillane and Landry did not provide sweeping guarantees, but the tenor of their comments suggested progress. The Patriots, like all Super Bowl participants, are navigating the final week with a mix of recovery work, practice reps and medical evaluations. Media night is often the first time a wide audience hears directly from injured players about their status, and both defenders used the platform to signal they are trending in the right direction.

If Spillane is able to go, it would bolster the middle of New England’s defense, where communication, run fits and coverage responsibilities are magnified against elite offenses. Linebackers are central to setting fronts and checks, and any limitation in that role can ripple through a unit. Spillane’s presence would help stabilize the second level and allow the Patriots to keep their preferred personnel groupings available.

Landry’s potential return would carry obvious implications for the pass rush. New England’s ability to pressure the quarterback — and to do so without excessive blitzing — is a common separator in postseason football. Edge defenders are also pivotal against the run, particularly when opponents try to slow down an aggressive rush with outside runs and quick-game passing concepts. Landry’s availability would give the Patriots another option to rotate and manage snaps in a game expected to be played at maximum intensity.

Injury situations often come down to late-week practice participation and how a player responds to increased workloads. The Patriots will continue to monitor both defenders through the remainder of Super Bowl week, with the final injury report and pregame warmups looming as key checkpoints.

For New England, the takeaway from media night was clear: two defenders the Patriots would prefer not to play without are at least putting themselves in the conversation to return. The next few days will determine whether optimism turns into availability — and whether the Patriots can enter the Super Bowl closer to full strength on the side of the ball that has defined their run.Two of the New England Patriots’ top defenders sounded optimistic about suiting up on the sport’s biggest stage, offering encouraging injury updates Tuesday night that could shape the team’s chances in the Super Bowl.
