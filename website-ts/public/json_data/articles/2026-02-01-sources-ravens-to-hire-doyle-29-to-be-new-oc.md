# Sources: Ravens to hire Doyle, 29, to be new OC

**Category:** Coaching News

The Baltimore Ravens are ushering in a new era for their offense, reportedly hiring Declan Doyle from the Chicago Bears as their new offensive coordinator. At just 29 years old, Doyle is set to become the youngest offensive playcaller in the entire National Football League, a move that signals a bold and potentially transformative direction for the AFC North contenders.

Sources familiar with the decision confirmed to ESPN's Adam Schefter that the deal is in place, solidifying one of the most talked-about coaching vacancies in recent weeks. Doyle's ascent to one of the league's most critical coaching roles at such a young age is nearly unprecedented, immediately placing him under intense scrutiny and spotlight as he prepares to take the reins of an offense featuring a former MVP quarterback in Lamar Jackson.

The decision to entrust a 29-year-old with the keys to an NFL offense speaks volumes about the Ravens organization's belief in Doyle's innovative potential and strategic acumen. This hire suggests the Ravens are prioritizing fresh perspectives and potentially a more modern, analytically-driven approach to offensive scheme and playcalling. For a team that has often leaned on a run-heavy identity, Doyle's influence could signal a significant evolution in their offensive philosophy, aiming to unlock new dimensions in their passing game while maintaining a potent ground attack.

While the specifics of Doyle's role with the Chicago Bears were not detailed, his rapid move from one NFL franchise to a coordinator position indicates a swift rise through the coaching ranks. The Ravens, after a season that saw them reach the AFC Championship Game but still face questions about their offensive consistency and ability to adapt in critical moments, clearly sought a change. This hire is a clear departure from traditional coordinator searches, which often favor veteran coaches with extensive playcalling experience. The Ravens' choice highlights a growing trend in the NFL towards younger, offensive-minded coaches who are perceived to bring creativity and a forward-thinking approach.

All eyes will now be on Doyle as he steps into this pivotal role, tasked with maximizing the talent around Jackson and developing a scheme that can consistently compete with the league's elite. His youth brings both immense pressure and the opportunity to redefine what an NFL offensive coordinator can be. The coming months will be crucial as Doyle installs his system, builds rapport with the players, and prepares to unveil a potentially revitalized Ravens offense, setting the stage for one of the most intriguing coaching storylines of the upcoming NFL season.
