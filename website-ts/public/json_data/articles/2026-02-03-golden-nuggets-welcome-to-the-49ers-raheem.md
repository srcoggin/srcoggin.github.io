The San Francisco 49ers signaled an early offseason focus on reshaping their backfield Monday, with Yahoo Sports NFL’s “Golden Nuggets” noting, “Welcome to the 49ers, Raheem!” — a development that immediately raises questions about how Kyle Shanahan’s offense will be staffed and structured heading into 2026.

The Yahoo Sports NFL item, published as the 49ers’ daily news roundup for Monday, Feb. 2, 2026, points to Raheem joining San Francisco, a move that connects the franchise to a familiar name for longtime followers of Shanahan’s run-heavy system. While the roundup format did not provide contract terms or a formal team announcement, the note itself underscored the significance: the 49ers are bringing in a running back with prior ties to the organization and a name that resonates with a fan base accustomed to San Francisco cycling through explosive, scheme-specific runners.

For the 49ers, the stakes are straightforward. Shanahan’s offense is built around marrying wide-zone runs with play-action and mismatches created by motion, requiring backs who can accelerate decisively and threaten defenses horizontally and vertically. Any move that alters the running back room matters, because San Francisco’s identity — and its week-to-week consistency — often hinges on that ground game functioning at a high level, particularly when injuries or game script pressure the passing attack.

The timing also matters. Early-February roster maneuvering can foreshadow broader offseason priorities, from depth-planning to cap and roster flexibility, even before free agency formally reshapes the league. Adding a veteran back can be interpreted as either a stabilizing move — insulating the team against attrition at a physically demanding position — or a sign that the front office is not satisfied with its current mix.

The development will be monitored in the coming days for confirmation of specifics, including whether the move is a futures deal, a reserve contract, or another transaction type that would affect offseason participation and roster accounting. What to watch next is how San Francisco’s running back rotation takes shape through the spring, and whether this “Raheem” addition is a standalone depth move or the first clue that the 49ers are preparing for bigger changes on offense as the 2026 roster comes into focus.The San Francisco 49ers signaled an early offseason focus on reshaping their backfield Monday, with Yahoo Sports NFL’s “Golden Nuggets” noting, “Welcome to the 49ers, Raheem!” — a development that immediately raises questions about how Kyle Shanahan’s offense will be staffed and structured heading into 2026.
