The Broncos kept a rising coaching candidate in-house, promoting Davis Webb to offensive coordinator in a move that signals both continuity and urgency for a franchise searching for stability on that side of the ball. Denver also elevated Logan Kilgore to quarterbacks coach, reshaping the staff around the most important task the team faces this offseason: building an offense that can consistently function at an NFL level.

Webb’s promotion comes after a busy stretch on the coaching carousel. He interviewed for head coaching jobs last month and was in the mix for offensive coordinator openings around the league, according to Pro Football Talk. Instead of leaving, Webb will remain in Denver and take over the Broncos’ offensive operation, a notable vote of confidence from a team that has cycled through play-callers and offensive approaches in recent years.

The move matters because it ties Denver’s offensive identity to a coach other teams were evaluating for bigger roles. Head-coaching interviews and coordinator interest are typically reserved for assistants viewed as upwardly mobile — the kind of candidate clubs try to keep when they believe he can help solve long-running issues. For Broncos fans, the promotion offers a clear signal that the organization intends to develop its offensive plan with an internal voice it believes is gaining league-wide credibility.

Kilgore’s elevation to quarterbacks coach further underscores the priority. The quarterbacks coach role sits at the intersection of weekly game planning and long-term development, and Denver’s decision to pair a new offensive coordinator with a promoted QB coach hints at a coordinated effort to streamline messaging, technique and preparation in the passing game.

Denver’s coaching changes arrive at a time when offensive infrastructure has become a key separator across the NFL, with the most consistent contenders typically pairing stable quarterback play with systems that maximize personnel and create answers against varied defensive looks. With Webb and Kilgore now in larger roles, the Broncos are betting that internal growth can translate into on-field production.

The next major indicator will come with how Denver fills out the rest of the offensive staff and defines responsibilities — including play-calling and scheme direction — heading into the offseason program. With Webb now running the offense and Kilgore tasked with guiding the quarterbacks room, what to watch is whether Denver’s approach produces the continuity and week-to-week improvement that have been difficult to sustain.The Broncos kept a rising coaching candidate in-house, promoting Davis Webb to offensive coordinator in a move that signals both continuity and urgency for a franchise searching for stability on that side of the ball.
