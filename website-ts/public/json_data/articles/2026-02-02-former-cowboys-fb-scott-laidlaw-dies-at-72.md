Former Dallas Cowboys fullback Scott Laidlaw has died at 72, according to a report from WFAA that was cited by Yahoo Sports and Pro Football Talk. News of Laidlaw’s death reverberated through a franchise that has long been defined by its history, underscoring how even lesser-known pieces of the Cowboys’ past remain part of the team’s identity for generations of fans.

Laidlaw’s death was reported by WFAA, with both Yahoo Sports and Pro Football Talk confirming the report. The outlets did not provide a cause of death or additional details surrounding his passing, and no further information was included in the source material.

While fullbacks rarely commanded the spotlight even in their era, they were integral to the kind of physical, run-oriented football that shaped how many fans came to understand NFL offenses. For the Cowboys, the position has historically carried a specific resonance — tied to the team’s reputation for toughness and the unglamorous work that supports star ball carriers and quarterbacks. Laidlaw’s connection to that role places him within a lineage that remains familiar to longtime Dallas supporters.

Laidlaw’s passing matters to NFL fans not because it changes a depth chart or a playoff race, but because it marks the loss of another player from a generation that helped build the league’s modern foundation. The Cowboys, in particular, have one of the sport’s most scrutinized and discussed histories; news involving former players routinely draws attention across the NFL landscape, especially among a fan base that tracks its alumni closely.

In the coming days, observers will watch for any additional information from the Cowboys or Laidlaw’s family, including potential public statements, memorial details or remembrances from former teammates and coaches. For a franchise that trades heavily on legacy, moments like this often prompt renewed reflection on the players whose contributions were measured in blocks, short-yardage collisions and the kind of work that rarely shows up in headlines — until a life is remembered.Former Dallas Cowboys fullback Scott Laidlaw has died at 72, according to a report from WFAA that was cited by Yahoo Sports and Pro Football Talk.
