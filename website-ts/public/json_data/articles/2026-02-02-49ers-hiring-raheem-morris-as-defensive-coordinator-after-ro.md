The San Francisco 49ers are turning to a familiar name to stabilize their defense after a major change on the coaching staff, with multiple reports saying the club is expected to hire Raheem Morris as its next defensive coordinator following Robert Saleh’s exit. The move would bring Morris back to the NFC West at a time when the 49ers’ ability to maintain continuity on defense has become a central offseason storyline.

Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk reported the 49ers are expected to hire Morris, noting he is “heading back to the NFC West.” The reports also framed the hire as the team’s response to Saleh leaving the role, a departure that created an immediate need for San Francisco to fill one of the most important jobs on coach Kyle Shanahan’s staff. The defensive coordinator position is particularly significant in Shanahan’s program because the 49ers’ identity has leaned heavily on a defense that can dictate game flow, generate stops and set up favorable field position for the offense.

Morris’ expected arrival carries added intrigue because it represents both continuity and change. Continuity, because Morris has history in the division and is familiar with the NFC West landscape; change, because he would be taking over a unit that had been led by Saleh and now must transition into a new voice and system. For the 49ers, the timing underscores how quickly teams must pivot in the NFL’s coaching carousel — especially when successful assistants are in demand and departures can ripple through an entire roster.

The importance of the defensive coordinator job in San Francisco goes beyond play-calling. The coordinator shapes weekly game plans, manages in-game adjustments and sets the tone for player development across all three levels of the defense. With Saleh out, the 49ers’ priority becomes ensuring the defense does not lose its edge during the transition, particularly against division opponents where familiarity and coaching details often swing close games.

If the hire is finalized, what to watch next is how quickly Morris can integrate with Shanahan’s staff and whether his return to the NFC West helps the 49ers maintain the kind of defensive consistency that keeps them in contention. In a division known for offensive innovation, the team’s ability to quickly settle on a coordinator — and keep the defense operating at a high level — could be one of the offseason’s most consequential developments.The San Francisco 49ers are turning to a familiar name to stabilize their defense after a major change on the coaching staff, with multiple reports saying the club is expected to hire Raheem Morris as its next defensive coordinator following Robert Saleh’s exit.
