The NFL’s championship game has become an American institution, a single Sunday that now carries its own cultural calendar. Yet one of the sport’s most recognizable brands — “Super Bowl” — was not born from a boardroom rollout or a marketing agency pitch. According to CBS Sports, the name that now defines the league’s biggest stage emerged from a mix of improvisation, wit and a child’s toy, eventually taking flight as the AFL and NFL edged toward the merger that reshaped pro football.

As CBS Sports detailed, the term traces back to Lamar Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs founder and a driving force in the AFL. Hunt’s inspiration came from the “Super Ball,” a bouncy toy that had become a fad at the time. The connection was simple but sticky: a “super” game deserved a “super” name. The moniker initially wasn’t the league’s formal choice, but it began to circulate as the AFL-NFL championship game took shape, a contest designed to settle supremacy between the rival leagues.

In the earliest days, the event was not even officially branded as the Super Bowl. CBS Sports noted that the league used a more literal — and far less memorable — description: the “AFL-NFL World Championship Game.” But the shorthand that Hunt helped popularize had staying power, cutting through the clunkiness of the original title and giving the championship a distinct identity that fans could latch onto year after year. The name’s adoption reflected more than clever wordplay; it marked the moment the sport’s biggest game started to become a standalone spectacle rather than merely the last contest on the schedule.

That evolution matters to NFL fans because branding and tradition help define how the league is experienced. “Super Bowl” is now the sport’s universal shorthand for ultimate stakes, and its emergence coincided with the broader transformation of pro football’s power structure. The AFL-NFL merger did more than unify teams under one umbrella — it produced a championship product strong enough to dominate the national conversation and, eventually, the global sports calendar.

The origin story also underscores how the NFL’s modern machine can still be shaped by unexpected sparks. A toy on a living-room floor helped nudge the sport toward a name that feels inevitable today — a reminder that the league’s biggest moments are not always engineered, even as the Super Bowl itself has become the most meticulously orchestrated event on the football calendar.

With each passing season, the NFL continues to add layers to the spectacle and meaning attached to the Super Bowl. But as CBS Sports highlighted, the game’s name remains a snapshot of its beginnings: a rapidly growing sport, a newly conceived championship, and a simple phrase that proved strong enough to carry an era.The NFL’s championship game has become an American institution, a single Sunday that now carries its own cultural calendar.
