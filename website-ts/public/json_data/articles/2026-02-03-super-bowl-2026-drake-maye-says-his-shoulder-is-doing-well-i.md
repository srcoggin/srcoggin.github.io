Drake Maye’s status had become one of the central questions hanging over Super Bowl week after the New England quarterback left the AFC championship game with a shoulder injury. On the eve of the sport’s biggest stage, Maye offered a measure of clarity — and relief — by saying the shoulder is “doing well” and that he expects to be ready when it matters most.

Maye told Yahoo Sports NFL that he is confident in his recovery after injuring the shoulder in the second half of the AFC championship game. “I’ll be just fine,” Maye said, a succinct reassurance that carries outsized significance given what is at stake for New England, its offense and a fan base staring at the possibility of entering Super Bowl 2026 without its starting quarterback at full strength.

The injury itself loomed immediately because it came in the second half of the conference title game, the moment when games tighten and quarterbacks are asked to make their biggest throws. Any shoulder issue — particularly for a passer — invites questions about velocity, accuracy and pain tolerance. Even if Maye is cleared to play, how he feels with a week of practices, media obligations and treatment can shape everything from the game plan to the play-calling aggression in a one-game championship setting.

Maye’s comments also matter because they stabilize the narrative around New England heading into the Super Bowl. When a quarterback’s health is uncertain, opponents can spend the week probing potential limitations, while coaches are forced to weigh contingency plans that can dilute preparation time. A clear message from the player himself can help keep the focus on execution rather than availability.

For readers unfamiliar with the situation, the timeline is straightforward: Maye sustained the shoulder injury during the second half of the AFC championship game, prompting immediate concern about whether he would be compromised — or worse — for the Super Bowl. His update suggests the injury is not expected to derail his ability to play, a critical development for a team whose postseason run has led it to the final weekend of the NFL calendar.

What to watch next will be whether Maye’s confidence translates to full participation and comfort in the days leading up to kickoff. In a Super Bowl, even small limitations can change how a quarterback plays and how a defense attacks. Maye’s promise that he will be “just fine” sets the expectation; now the league’s biggest spotlight will test it.Drake Maye’s status had become one of the central questions hanging over Super Bowl week after the New England quarterback left the AFC championship game with a shoulder injury.
