The NFL’s 2025 offseason has again underlined a familiar reality: while blockbuster draft picks and splashy extensions dominate the headlines, the league’s competitive balance often turns on veteran acquisitions — and on how quickly those contracts either look like bargains or become burdens. In a wide-ranging review of the year’s biggest veteran deals, CBS Sports’ “Agent’s Take” framed the 2025 contract landscape through a simple lens — “the good, the bad and the ugly” — with quarterback Sam Darnold headlining a class of signings that could shape playoff races and front-office futures alike.

Darnold’s place at the center of that conversation illustrates why veteran contracts matter so much to teams trying to win now without mortgaging the future. Quarterback remains the league’s most expensive and consequential position, and a veteran addition can change a franchise’s trajectory in a matter of months. CBS Sports positioned Darnold and other veteran acquisitions as the stars of the 2025 contract “awards,” a nod to how quickly perception can swing depending on performance and availability — and how much risk is baked into every guaranteed dollar.

The “Agent’s Take” premise also speaks to the leaguewide tension teams face under the salary cap: contend while staying flexible. Veteran deals, especially at premium positions, are frequently built to balance short-term urgency with long-term escape hatches. That structure can protect clubs if a player disappoints, but it can also push pain into future years through prorated bonuses and cap accounting. When a veteran hits, the signing can stabilize a locker room and allow a coaching staff to run its full system. When it fails, the same contract can limit roster building and force teams into difficult cuts or restructures.

For fans, the stakes are immediate. A veteran quarterback addition like Darnold can determine whether a team remains competitive into December or spends another season searching for answers. Beyond the standings, these deals can influence how franchises approach the draft, whether they extend cornerstone players, and how aggressively they pursue other free agents.

What to watch next is how quickly the 2025 veteran class delivers on those deals once meaningful games begin. CBS Sports’ framing — separating outcomes into good, bad and ugly — is ultimately a reminder that the verdict on every offseason contract is written on Sundays, with reputations, cap sheets and coaching tenures often riding along.The NFL’s 2025 offseason has again underlined a familiar reality: while blockbuster draft picks and splashy extensions dominate the headlines, the league’s competitive balance often turns on veteran acquisitions — and on how quickly those contracts either look like bargains or become burdens.
