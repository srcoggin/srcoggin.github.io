The Baltimore Ravens are set to bring Anthony Weaver back to the organization, with Pro Football Talk reporting the club is hiring him as its defensive coordinator — a significant move for a franchise that has long defined itself by defense and continuity on that side of the ball.

Weaver’s return signals a comfort level on both sides. He is familiar with Baltimore’s expectations, its culture and the kind of defensive identity the team has traditionally leaned on to stay in contention. For the Ravens, turning to a coach with prior experience in the building can be as much about preserving standards as it is about scheme, particularly at a position as influential as defensive coordinator.

Pro Football Talk reported simply that “Anthony Weaver is headed back to Baltimore,” underscoring the central takeaway: the Ravens are opting for a known commodity as they reshape their defensive leadership. Coordinator hires often ripple through the entire roster, influencing everything from how a front seven is used to how much pressure is placed on a secondary. Even without details on the specific schematic direction, the decision matters because it helps define what the Ravens want to be — and how quickly they expect to get there.

For fans, the coordinator seat carries outsized weight in Baltimore. The Ravens’ brand has been tied to physical, disciplined defense for years, and the organization has often treated defensive structure as a pillar alongside its offense and special teams. Installing Weaver provides an immediate point of reference: this is not an outsider learning the Ravens from scratch, but a coach returning to a place where he already understands the internal demands.

The hire also adds clarity to the Ravens’ coaching staff at a time of annual leaguewide churn, when coordinator changes can reshape matchups and dictate offseason decisions across the NFL. Defensive coordinators are tasked not only with play-calling but also with developing young players, defining weekly game plans and, in many cases, collaborating on roster priorities that can affect how teams allocate resources.

What comes next will be how Weaver’s role is defined in Baltimore and how that definition shows up on the field. The Ravens’ offseason now includes building a defensive approach that fits the personnel and withstands the weekly chess match of the AFC. For a team that expects to contend, the early focus will be on whether bringing Weaver back can sustain — and sharpen — a defensive identity that remains central to its path forward.The Baltimore Ravens are set to bring Anthony Weaver back to the organization, with Pro Football Talk reporting the club is hiring him as its defensive coordinator — a significant move for a franchise that has long defined itself by defense and continuity on that side of the ball.
