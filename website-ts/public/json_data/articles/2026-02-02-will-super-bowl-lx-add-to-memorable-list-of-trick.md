Super Bowl LX has no shortage of star power or tactical intrigue, but one of the most compelling subplots heading into Sunday is whether the game will deliver another signature trick-play moment — and whether Mike Vrabel will again be at the center of it.

As ESPN NFL noted in preview coverage, Vrabel built a surprising Super Bowl résumé as a touchdown-catching threat, hauling in TD passes in two Super Bowls on plays that caught opponents off guard. For a player better known for his defensive role and rugged, no-nonsense reputation, those scores became part of Super Bowl lore — the kind of unexpected wrinkle that can swing a game and linger in highlight packages for decades.

That history matters because the Super Bowl often comes down to a handful of snaps: one busted coverage, one perfectly timed call, one player deployed in an uncharacteristic role. Coaches and coordinators spend months crafting packages designed specifically for this stage, where the reward for deception is amplified and the cost of predictability is often fatal. Vrabel’s two touchdowns — both coming on surprising designs — underscore a core playoff truth: elite preparation is about more than execution; it is about forcing an opponent to hesitate for just a beat.

For readers unfamiliar with the backstory, Vrabel’s uniqueness lies in the contrast between job description and outcome. Defensive players rarely become red-zone receiving options, much less in the sport’s biggest game. Yet Vrabel did it twice, turning a novelty role into tangible points on the scoreboard. ESPN’s framing heading into Super Bowl LX reflects how those plays helped cement Vrabel as a symbol of the Super Bowl’s enduring capacity for reinvention — where even well-scouted teams can be caught by something they have not seen, or have not seen recently, at precisely the wrong time.

The question entering Super Bowl LX is not simply whether a trick play will appear, but whether it will be decisive. The game’s tight margins make that possibility real. A single gadget call can flip field position, steal a touchdown, or force an opponent to abandon parts of its plan. It also adds a layer of chess-match tension for fans: identifying when the moment is right, and which personnel grouping might tip it off.

Sunday’s spotlight will be on whether Super Bowl LX adds another entry to that memorable list — and whether someone can match, or even “enhance,” the reputation Vrabel earned when a defensive stalwart became an unlikely touchdown receiver on the sport’s grandest stage.Super Bowl LX has no shortage of star power or tactical intrigue, but one of the most compelling subplots heading into Sunday is whether the game will deliver another signature trick-play moment — and whether Mike Vrabel will again be at the center of it.
