Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in 2026, adding one of the world’s biggest music stars to the NFL’s most-watched annual stage and extending the event’s long-running tradition of pairing the league’s championship game with pop culture’s widest reach. CBS Sports NFL, which published a comprehensive history of Super Bowl halftime performers, reported the 2026 selection while looking ahead to Super Bowl LX and revisiting the artists who have helped turn the break between halves into a standalone global attraction.

The NFL’s halftime show has evolved into far more than an intermission. It is a centerpiece of Super Bowl week, an entertainment tentpole that draws casual viewers, drives social media conversation and often becomes as discussed as the game itself. The league’s championship already commands massive interest; the halftime show widens that funnel, providing another reason for non-diehard fans to tune in and for sponsors and broadcasters to invest in the event’s sprawling presentation.

CBS Sports’ roundup underscores the scope of that history, noting it includes “every Super Bowl halftime performer in history” as the sport prepares for Super Bowl LX. The list traces the event’s transformation over decades, reflecting changing tastes and the NFL’s shifting approach to staging. Early Super Bowls featured traditional variety and marching-band style entertainment before modern pop, rock, hip-hop and crossover stars increasingly became the norm, turning halftime into a carefully curated spectacle with its own set of expectations — surprise guests, elaborate staging and moments built to go viral.

Bad Bunny’s selection is the latest indication of how the NFL continues to emphasize global reach. His appeal spans languages and markets, and his presence figures to resonate with younger audiences and a broad international fan base — a significant factor as the league continues to expand its footprint and as the Super Bowl remains one of the few true appointment-viewing events on the American calendar.

For NFL fans, the news matters because halftime programming has become part of the Super Bowl’s identity, shaping the overall experience of championship Sunday. The performer announcement also signals the start of another familiar countdown: the months of speculation about production scale, possible guest appearances and how the show will complement the game’s pageantry.

With Super Bowl LX still on the horizon, attention now turns to how the league and its partners will build around Bad Bunny’s headlining slot — and how the next edition of the NFL’s biggest stage will again try to deliver a game worthy of an event that, for one night, sits at the intersection of sports and global entertainment.Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in 2026, adding one of the world’s biggest music stars to the NFL’s most-watched annual stage and extending the event’s long-running tradition of pairing the league’s championship game with pop culture’s widest reach.
