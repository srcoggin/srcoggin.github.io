The Pittsburgh Steelers continued to build out their coaching staff, adding three assistants while also moving forward with their search for an offensive coordinator. The additions, highlighted by the hiring of defensive pass game coordinator Jason Simmons, come as the organization balances immediate staffing needs with a bigger-picture question: who will shape the team’s offense moving into the next season.

According to Pro Football Talk, Pittsburgh is set to interview offensive coordinator candidate Scott Tolzien on Monday. At the same time, the Steelers officially added three coaches to the staff. Simmons is the most prominent of the trio, taking on a role that typically touches everything from weekly coverage plans to opponent-specific adjustments in the passing game. In an era where matchups and explosive plays increasingly define outcomes, the pass game coordinator title underscores how teams are carving out specialized responsibilities across their staffs.

The report also notes the hires were additions to head coach Mike McCarthy’s staff. Regardless of how responsibilities ultimately shake out, the dual-track approach — interviewing coordinator candidates while bringing in assistants — reflects the practical reality of NFL coaching cycles. Teams often have to move quickly to secure position coaches and specialists even as they continue vetting the high-impact coordinator seats that most directly influence scheme and identity.

Tolzien’s interview adds another data point to the Steelers’ offensive coordinator process. Coordinator searches have become a major offseason storyline across the league because of the influence play callers have on quarterback development, weekly game planning and overall scoring efficiency. For Pittsburgh, the offensive coordinator decision will be closely watched by fans and evaluators alike, given how much a play-caller can dictate tempo, personnel usage and in-game adjustments.

The timing also matters. Coaching hires and interviews at this stage of the calendar can shape everything that follows, from how the team evaluates its current roster to what it prioritizes in free agency and the draft. Even assistant coach hires can influence player development and weekly preparation, especially on defense, where pass coverage and disguise packages are increasingly central to slowing modern offenses.

With Tolzien’s interview ahead and multiple staff positions now filled, the next step for Pittsburgh will be clarifying the rest of its coaching structure and determining who ultimately leads the offense. Until that decision is made, the Steelers’ offseason picture remains incomplete — but the steady accumulation of staff moves suggests the organization is accelerating toward finalizing the framework it believes can win next season.The Pittsburgh Steelers continued to build out their coaching staff, adding three assistants while also moving forward with their search for an offensive coordinator.
