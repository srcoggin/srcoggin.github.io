Rumors of the NFL’s next European expansion have put the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints at the center of an early storyline — one that could connect a landmark moment for the league with one of its most watched young quarterbacks. A report from Yahoo Sports NFL said “rumors, just rumors” suggest the Browns could face the Saints in Paris on the NFL’s 2026 schedule, a game that would be billed as France’s first regular-season NFL contest.

While the league has not announced any 2026 international slate or confirmed a Paris game, the mere possibility underscores how aggressively the NFL continues to push its footprint overseas. The league has steadily added international games in recent seasons, and a debut in Paris would represent another high-profile step, both commercially and culturally, into a major European market.

The Yahoo Sports report added an additional wrinkle: Cleveland’s game in Paris “could include Shedeur Sanders.” The quarterback’s name has hovered near the center of offseason buzz for multiple reasons, and pairing a heavily scrutinized passer with a historic international setting would be a made-for-television draw for the league. The report did not specify what Sanders’ role would be, only that the rumor included his involvement in the potential matchup.

For Cleveland, the speculation arrives at a time when the franchise remains one of the NFL’s most closely tracked teams, with quarterback questions often defining the news cycle. The Browns have also become a frequent point of interest in the league’s broader scheduling ecosystem, as the NFL continues to place premium games in stand-alone windows and international venues to maximize global viewership.

The Saints’ inclusion in the rumor highlights how the NFL often deploys recognizable brands to help launch new markets. New Orleans also brings a distinct identity and fan base that can translate on an international stage — an important element when the league is introducing the sport to first-time or casual audiences.

Nothing in the Yahoo Sports report indicated the matchup is finalized, and the outlet emphasized the unconfirmed nature of the information. Still, the rumor is notable for what it signals: the NFL’s increasing willingness to use international games not only as business ventures, but as tentpole events designed to showcase star power, storylines and teams with national pull.

If Paris is indeed on the 2026 calendar, the months ahead will bring clues through venue discussions, team marketing plans and the league’s eventual schedule release. Until then, what bears watching is whether the Browns and Saints remain linked — and whether Sanders’ name continues to follow the rumor from speculation into something more concrete.Rumors of the NFL’s next European expansion have put the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints at the center of an early storyline — one that could connect a landmark moment for the league with one of its most watched young quarterbacks.
