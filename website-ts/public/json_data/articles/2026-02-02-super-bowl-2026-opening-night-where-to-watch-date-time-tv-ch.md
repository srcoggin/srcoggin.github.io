Super Bowl week is officially underway, and the NFL’s biggest stage is shifting from preparation to pageantry as Opening Night arrives for Seahawks-Patriots, the league’s first full-scale media showcase ahead of Super Bowl 2026. The annual kickoff event, carried live for a national audience, marks the first time players and coaches from both teams will be available in a single, highly choreographed setting — and it sets the tone for everything that follows in the build to Sunday.

CBS Sports NFL’s preview of the event underscores the practical question that dominates fans’ calendars at this point of the season: where and how to watch. Opening Night for Seahawks-Patriots will air on television and be available via streaming, with CBS Sports noting the date, time, TV channel, stream options and the broader schedule as Super Bowl week begins. For viewers, it is the first opportunity to see both teams together in one place, hear from the principals in real time and get the league’s official start to its largest week.

Opening Night has evolved into more than a press conference. It is the NFL’s opening production of Super Bowl week, serving sponsors, broadcasters and fans while funneling the first wave of storylines into the national conversation. For the Seahawks and Patriots, it provides a controlled environment to address the buildup, from roster availability to game-plan themes, with every answer dissected as part of the Super Bowl’s annual microscope.

For Seattle, the moment signals a return to the league’s biggest spotlight, one that can shape how the franchise is discussed beyond a single game. For New England, it is another trip to the sport’s center stage, where routine questions can carry outsized weight amid the week’s relentless coverage. The significance for fans is straightforward: Opening Night often reveals the first hints of how each team wants to frame the matchup — whether it emphasizes confidence, underdog edge, experience or composure — and it becomes the baseline for the narratives that echo through the rest of the week.

With Super Bowl week now in motion, the schedule ahead will only intensify. After Opening Night, attention turns to successive media availabilities, practice coverage and the final ramp-up before kickoff. The Seahawks and Patriots will spend the early part of the week balancing football preparation with obligations that come with the Super Bowl stage, and fans will be watching closely not just for sound bites, but for any small signal that hints at how the sport’s biggest game might tilt.Super Bowl week is officially underway, and the NFL’s biggest stage is shifting from preparation to pageantry as Opening Night arrives for Seahawks-Patriots, the league’s first full-scale media showcase ahead of Super Bowl 2026.
