NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league needs more information before drawing conclusions about New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch after reports surfaced that Tisch exchanged multiple emails with Jeffrey Epstein.

Goodell addressed the matter during his Super Bowl week press conference, where he was asked twice about the revelation involving Tisch and Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died in jail in 2019. Goodell did not offer specifics about the content or timing of the emails, but emphasized caution and process, saying, “Let’s get the facts first.”

The commissioner’s comments underscored how quickly off-field issues involving league power brokers can become on-field storylines for franchises, particularly as the NFL’s owners remain the ultimate decision-makers in hiring, spending and long-term organizational direction. Tisch is one of the Giants’ most visible leaders and has been part of the club’s ownership structure for decades, making the development significant not only for the team but for the league’s broader governance and public image.

Goodell’s response signaled the NFL is not prepared, at least publicly, to outline potential steps or disciplinary considerations without more clarity. The league has faced heightened scrutiny in recent years over how it handles matters that touch on personal conduct and reputational risk, whether involving players, coaches or executives. In this case, the questions revolve around a team owner, a category that sits at the top of the NFL’s power structure and is typically governed by league bylaws and internal processes rather than the personal conduct policy used for players.

The Giants, one of the league’s flagship franchises, operate under an ownership group led by the Mara and Tisch families. Any uncertainty around the standing of a co-owner can create questions about stability at the highest level, even if day-to-day football decisions are handled by the front office and coaching staff.

For fans, the issue matters because ownership shapes everything from organizational culture to spending and patience in rebuilding cycles. What comes next will depend on what additional details become public and whether the league deems any further review necessary. For now, Goodell’s message was clear: the NFL is in wait-and-see mode, and the next development will be driven by facts, not speculation.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league needs more information before drawing conclusions about New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch after reports surfaced that Tisch exchanged multiple emails with Jeffrey Epstein.
