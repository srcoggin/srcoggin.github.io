Super Bowl 60 is set to deliver a marquee matchup with a familiar postseason weight: the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will meet for the NFL championship in Santa Clara, a pairing that CBS Sports’ NFL coverage framed as a comprehensive “cheat sheet” moment for fans tracking everything from the game itself to the halftime show. The league’s biggest stage, and the sport’s most-watched annual event, returns with two franchises that have helped define modern NFL eras, raising the stakes for a national audience that treats Super Bowl Sunday as both a sporting and cultural appointment.

The Patriots and Seahawks will play for the Lombardi Trophy with the spotlight centered on the full Super Bowl 60 presentation — the teams, the venue in Santa Clara and the surrounding spectacle. CBS Sports billed its roundup as “everything to know” about Seahawks vs. Patriots, including the halftime show and other key Super Bowl elements, underscoring how the event extends well beyond the 60 minutes on the field. For many fans, that broad framing matters: the Super Bowl is where legacies can be cemented, offseason narratives can shift instantly and the NFL’s entertainment machine operates at its peak.

Santa Clara again serves as the focal point, with the championship game bringing the NFL’s traveling circus to Northern California. The matchup also taps into a deep well of fan investment. New England’s brand is built on sustained excellence and Super Bowl expectations, while Seattle has long been associated with a hard-edged identity and a track record of rising to the moment when the stakes are highest. Putting those two helmets across from each other on the final Sunday of the season is the kind of pairing the league covets — one that draws in casual viewers while giving diehards plenty to dissect, from coaching decisions to roster construction and the psychological grind of a two-week Super Bowl buildup.

CBS Sports’ cheat-sheet approach reflects the way modern Super Bowl coverage has evolved into an all-encompassing guide for viewers: the game, the halftime show and the details that shape the weeklong conversation. That matters for NFL fans because the championship isn’t simply a conclusion; it is a launching point. A win can validate an organizational blueprint, while a loss can magnify questions that will linger through the offseason.

As kickoff approaches in Santa Clara, the biggest thing to watch is how each team handles the magnitude of the moment — and how the full Super Bowl 60 production, from pregame pageantry to halftime, frames what will be remembered long after the final whistle.Super Bowl 60 is set to deliver a marquee matchup with a familiar postseason weight: the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will meet for the NFL championship in Santa Clara, a pairing that CBS Sports’ NFL coverage framed as a comprehensive “cheat sheet” moment for fans tracking everything from the game itself to the halftime show.
