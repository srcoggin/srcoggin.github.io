The Baltimore Ravens are reshaping the top of John Harbaugh’s staff with a move that blends familiarity and fresh responsibility, hiring Anthony Weaver away from Miami to run the defense and confirming Declan Doyle as the team’s offensive coordinator. The changes give Baltimore a new defensive play-caller with deep organizational ties while formally placing a young assistant in charge of an offense that has been central to the Ravens’ identity.

Weaver arrives in Baltimore after serving as the Dolphins’ defensive coordinator, stepping into the same role with the Ravens. The hire also brings Weaver back to a franchise where he has both playing and coaching roots. Weaver played for the Ravens and previously worked in Baltimore on Harbaugh’s coaching staff, giving him first-hand knowledge of the program’s culture and expectations. That history matters for a team that has long valued continuity on defense and has often elevated coaches who understand the Ravens’ internal standards.

The move signals a clear intent: keep the defense aligned with the broader organizational vision while turning to a coordinator who has already worked inside the building. In a league where coaching transitions can take months to settle, Weaver’s familiarity with the Ravens’ environment could shorten the acclimation period and allow the defense to move quickly into offseason planning.

On the other side of the ball, Baltimore confirmed Doyle as offensive coordinator, formalizing a role that will come with significant influence over weekly game plans and in-game adjustments. While coordinator titles can vary in responsibility from team to team, the confirmation provides clarity on how the Ravens will structure their offensive leadership going forward. For fans and opponents alike, the appointment is an early indicator of how Baltimore intends to keep its offensive approach coherent through another offseason of roster-building and scheme development.

The two announcements underscore a broader theme for Baltimore: continuity paired with targeted change. Weaver’s return offers a bridge between the Ravens’ past and their next iteration, while Doyle’s confirmation provides a defined point of leadership on offense as the organization begins mapping out its spring and summer work.

What to watch next will be how quickly the staff rounds into full form around Weaver and Doyle — from position coach responsibilities to the finer details of scheme installation — and whether Baltimore’s offseason additions and departures align with the new coordinator structure. For a franchise that measures itself by postseason success, these hires are the first visible steps in shaping what the Ravens will look like when they take the field again.The Baltimore Ravens are reshaping the top of John Harbaugh’s staff with a move that blends familiarity and fresh responsibility, hiring Anthony Weaver away from Miami to run the defense and confirming Declan Doyle as the team’s offensive coordinator.
