The Cleveland Browns are turning to Baltimore for a key piece of their offensive staff, hiring Ravens run game coordinator Travis Switzer as offensive coordinator, league sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The move gives new Browns coach Todd Monken a trusted assistant with recent AFC North experience as Cleveland reshapes its offense under a new leadership group.

Switzer’s hiring is significant not only because it fills one of the most influential roles on an NFL coaching staff, but also because it reflects Monken’s intent to import ideas and continuity from a division rival that has been a fixture near the top of the conference. By bringing Switzer from Baltimore, the Browns are adding a coach who has been immersed in game-planning and weekly run-game structure in a scheme that has been tested against the same opponents Cleveland faces every year.

According to ESPN, the Browns are hiring Switzer to join Monken’s staff, linking the new head coach with an assistant he knows and trusts. In modern roster-building, the offensive coordinator often serves as the connective tissue between the head coach’s overall philosophy, the quarterback’s weekly plan and a team’s ability to establish an identity on early downs — responsibilities that can define how quickly a first-year head coach stabilizes an operation.

Switzer arrives from the Ravens with the title of run game coordinator, a role that typically involves crafting the run-game menu, building complementary play-action answers and coordinating weekly adjustments based on opponent fronts and personnel. While the Browns’ specific schematic direction under Monken will come into focus over the coming months, the decision to hire a run-game specialist from Baltimore suggests Cleveland is emphasizing structure and physicality in the way it wants to operate offensively, particularly within a division known for rugged defensive play.

The hire also underscores the competitive nature of the AFC North’s coaching carousel, where staff movement can quickly become a chess match of familiar concepts, terminology and tells. Cleveland’s decision to draw from a rival’s staff adds another layer to that dynamic, placing Switzer in position to help the Browns prepare for — and attack — the opponents he has recently been game-planning against.

Next up will be how quickly the Browns finalize the rest of Monken’s offensive staff and how responsibilities are divided between head coach and coordinator. Training camp installation, the development of timing and terminology, and how seamlessly Switzer’s run-game background translates into full-playcalling duties will be among the central storylines as the Browns attempt to hit the ground running under their new regime.The Cleveland Browns are turning to Baltimore for a key piece of their offensive staff, hiring Ravens run game coordinator Travis Switzer as offensive coordinator, league sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
