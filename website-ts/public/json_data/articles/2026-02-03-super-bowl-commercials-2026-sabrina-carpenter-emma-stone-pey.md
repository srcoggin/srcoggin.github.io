Super Bowl 60 is still months away, but the marketing arms race around the NFL’s biggest stage is already taking shape, with early commercial teasers pointing to another celebrity-heavy lineup that will compete for attention alongside the game itself. CBS Sports reported that pop star Sabrina Carpenter, actor Emma Stone and former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning are among the headliners featured in early previews for Super Bowl commercials in 2026, signaling what it described as “another star-studded crop of commercials for Super Bowl 60.”

The early rollouts underscore how the Super Bowl has evolved into more than a championship game. For many viewers, the broadcast has become a three-hour showcase in which advertising and entertainment carry their own cultural weight. Brands often use teasers to build momentum well ahead of kickoff, leaning on recognizable faces who can cut through the clutter of pregame coverage and the constant churn of social media.

Carpenter’s inclusion reflects the continuing trend of advertisers tapping chart-topping music acts who bring built-in fan bases and online reach to the event. Stone’s appearance points to the premium placed on established Hollywood star power, particularly for spots that aim to be cinematic or comedic. Manning, a familiar Super Bowl advertising presence, represents a different kind of celebrity cachet: an NFL icon whose reputation and broadcasting profile make him a natural fit for campaigns pitched directly at football audiences.

For the league and its broadcast partners, the annual spike in advertising buzz is not a sideshow — it is a core part of what keeps the Super Bowl at the center of the American sports calendar. Commercials are among the most discussed elements of the telecast, often generating their own postgame reaction and ranking culture. They also help set the tone for a weekend in which the NFL positions itself as both a sporting event and a broader entertainment tentpole.

The teasers also arrive at a moment when the NFL continues to lean into year-round engagement, from offseason transaction cycles to schedule releases and international expansions. Super Bowl advertising plays into that ecosystem by turning game week into a multi-platform event that extends beyond the final score, reaching casual fans who might tune in as much for the spectacle as for the matchup.

With more commercials expected to be revealed as Super Bowl 60 approaches, the early indications suggest familiar themes: big names, high production value and an effort to create moments that can live long after the last whistle. For NFL fans, it is an early reminder that the Super Bowl experience is built not only on who reaches the championship stage, but also on the spotlight that comes with it — and the celebrities eager to share it.Super Bowl 60 is still months away, but the marketing arms race around the NFL’s biggest stage is already taking shape, with early commercial teasers pointing to another celebrity-heavy lineup that will compete for attention alongside the game itself.
