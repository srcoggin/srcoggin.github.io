The Buffalo Bills have filled a key spot on their offensive staff, hiring Drew Terrell as wide receivers coach in a move that further rounds out head coach Joe Brady’s group as the team looks ahead to its next phase on offense. The hire, first reported by Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk, gives Brady a dedicated position coach to oversee one of the most important units in Buffalo’s attack.

Brady, who is leading the Bills’ offense, “has landed a wide receivers coach,” according to both outlets. Terrell will take on the day-to-day responsibility of developing Buffalo’s wideouts, installing technique and fundamentals, and helping translate Brady’s weekly game plans into consistent production on Sundays. Wide receiver coaching is often an under-the-radar job, but it carries outsized importance for a team that wants to keep its passing game efficient and explosive — especially in an AFC where high-scoring offenses regularly decide playoff races.

The Bills’ decision to add Terrell also underscores how heavily the organization is investing in continuity and detail around its offensive identity. A wide receivers coach works at the intersection of scheme and execution: releases versus press coverage, route depth and spacing, timing with the quarterback, and situational adjustments that can turn tight-window throws into chain-moving completions. Those are the margins that matter for contenders, and Buffalo has operated in that tier for years.

While neither report included further detail about Terrell’s background or the terms of the hire, the appointment itself is a notable checkpoint in Brady’s ongoing effort to build out a staff that matches his approach. By choosing a specific wide receivers coach now, the Bills are signaling an emphasis on targeted development and sharper communication within the passing game — areas that can determine how smoothly an offense runs, particularly early in a season.

For Buffalo, the coaching move matters because the passing game remains central to everything the team wants to be. Wide receivers are asked to do more than catch passes; they are critical to dictating coverages, creating space for other targets and sustaining rhythm across a full game. A position coach can help define roles, sharpen technique and ensure the group remains connected to the quarterback and play caller.

Looking ahead, the focus will shift to how Terrell integrates with Brady’s staff and how quickly that collaboration shows up in the performance of Buffalo’s wideouts once on-field work ramps up. For fans, the early indicator to watch will be whether the Bills’ receivers look more precise and in sync in the new setup — the type of subtle improvement that can swing close games in January.The Buffalo Bills have filled a key spot on their offensive staff, hiring Drew Terrell as wide receivers coach in a move that further rounds out head coach Joe Brady’s group as the team looks ahead to its next phase on offense.
