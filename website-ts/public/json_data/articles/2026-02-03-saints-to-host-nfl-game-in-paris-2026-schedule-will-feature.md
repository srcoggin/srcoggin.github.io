The NFL will play its first regular-season game in France in 2026, with the New Orleans Saints set to serve as the designated host in Paris, a landmark step in the league’s expanding international footprint. CBS Sports NFL reported the development under the headline, “Saints to host NFL game in Paris: 2026 schedule will feature NFL’s first international game ever in France,” underscoring the significance of taking a major U.S. sports property to one of Europe’s most prominent markets.

The move positions Paris — “the City of Light,” as CBS Sports noted — as the newest addition to the NFL’s international schedule rotation. While the league has staged regular-season games in multiple international locations in recent years, the 2026 contest will represent its first in France, a country that has not previously hosted an NFL regular-season game. The decision to use a regular-season date, rather than an exhibition, reflects how central overseas games have become to the league’s calendar and its broader business strategy.

For the Saints, being tagged as the home team provides a franchise-branded focal point for the NFL’s France debut. A designated host typically carries the marketing push in the region tied to the event, and it also shapes logistics for the schedule, including which team gives up a home date and how the rest of the slate is balanced. The selection of New Orleans also gives the league a recognizable brand to introduce itself in a new European venue, with the Saints’ identity and fan culture serving as a centerpiece of the event.

From a fan perspective, the announcement matters because it signals both the continued growth of international regular-season games and the league’s willingness to place meaningful outcomes on the global stage. A game in Paris will not just be a one-off novelty; it will be part of the 2026 schedule, meaning it will count in the standings and impact playoff races like any other Sunday.

Details such as the Saints’ opponent, the exact date, kickoff time and the specific Paris venue were not included in the CBS Sports report. Those elements will shape the competitive and travel implications, including how the NFL manages rest and recovery around transatlantic flights.

For now, the takeaway is clear: the NFL is headed to France, and the Saints will be at the center of it. The next major checkpoint will come with further league scheduling announcements, when the matchup and logistics are finalized and the event shifts from concept to calendar reality.The NFL will play its first regular-season game in France in 2026, with the New Orleans Saints set to serve as the designated host in Paris, a landmark step in the league’s expanding international footprint.
