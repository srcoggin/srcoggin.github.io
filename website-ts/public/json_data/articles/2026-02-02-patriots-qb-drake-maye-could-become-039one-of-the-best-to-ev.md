Mack Brown has spent decades around high-level quarterbacks, and the former North Carolina coach is not hedging when it comes to Drake Maye’s ceiling as the New England Patriots begin shaping their future around the young passer. Brown told CBS Sports NFL that Maye could become “one of the best to ever play,” a sweeping endorsement that underscores both the expectations and urgency surrounding the Patriots’ rebuild.

Brown’s praise carries particular weight because it comes from the coach who oversaw Maye’s rise at North Carolina. Maye’s college career made him one of the most scrutinized quarterback prospects of his class, and his transition to the NFL has been treated as a pivotal development for a New England franchise trying to regain stability at the position. Brown described Maye as an “MVP finalist” in the CBS Sports report, a label that speaks to the magnitude of the belief from his former coach and the level of performance Brown thinks is possible at the professional level.

For the Patriots, the significance is straightforward: franchise quarterbacks drive everything. New England’s roster-building timeline, coaching direction and long-term competitiveness are tied to whether Maye becomes a legitimate difference-maker. When a coach with Brown’s résumé publicly forecasts historic greatness, it adds another layer to the conversation around Maye — not simply whether he can develop into a solid starter, but whether he can become the kind of player who lifts a team into annual contention.

Brown’s comments also provide context for why Maye drew such attention long before he reached the NFL. At North Carolina, Maye played under a coach known for developing and managing offensive talent, and Brown’s assessment suggests Maye’s tools and makeup separate him from typical prospects. That type of endorsement can resonate inside NFL buildings, where evaluators and coaches often weigh a player’s leadership, work habits and capacity to handle pressure as heavily as arm talent.

The other implication is what it does to the Patriots’ expectations — and patience. If Maye is viewed internally and externally as a potential cornerstone, the organization’s choices on coaching, supporting cast and offensive identity become even more consequential. A quarterback can accelerate a rebuild, but only if the infrastructure around him is sturdy enough to allow growth.

Maye’s next steps will be watched closely, particularly how he adapts to NFL defenses and how New England structures its offense to maximize his strengths. Brown’s forecast set the bar sky-high. The Patriots’ task now is turning that projection into production.Mack Brown has spent decades around high-level quarterbacks, and the former North Carolina coach is not hedging when it comes to Drake Maye’s ceiling as the New England Patriots begin shaping their future around the young passer.
