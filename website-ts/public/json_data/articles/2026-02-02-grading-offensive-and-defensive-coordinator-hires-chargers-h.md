The NFL’s annual coordinator carousel rarely produces immediate consensus, but CBS Sports’ early grades on the latest wave of hires underscored a clear theme: teams are doubling down on specialized play-calling and schematic fit, with the Los Angeles Chargers and Philadelphia Eagles drawing the strongest early marks for moves designed to change the trajectory of their offenses.

In CBS Sports’ roundup of offensive and defensive coordinator hires, the Chargers were pegged as one of the biggest winners, with the outlet calling their coordinator addition a “home run.” The assessment reflects how central coordinator choices have become in a league defined by matchup football and weekly game-planning edges. For a Chargers team looking to translate talent into consistent results, the expectation attached to a “home run” hire is immediate: cleaner offensive structure, more coherent weekly identity and better in-game problem solving.

Philadelphia’s move drew similar significance in CBS Sports’ evaluation, which noted the Eagles “finally land a play-caller.” In a league where head coaches frequently carry play-calling duties — and where offensive direction can become muddled when responsibilities are split — securing a designated play-caller is often viewed as a stabilizing step. For the Eagles, that framing matters because it signals a deliberate effort to clarify the offensive chain of command and set a defined weekly voice in the headset, an element that can shape everything from tempo to red-zone decision making.

CBS Sports’ grading exercise also served as a broader snapshot of what teams are chasing with these hires: not simply new faces, but answers. Coordinator changes are frequently about more than replacing a departed assistant; they are course corrections meant to address stalled units, maximize quarterback development and install systems that fit existing personnel. In practice, those goals can influence roster decisions, too — from which skill sets are prioritized in free agency to how draft resources are allocated — because coordinators often drive what a front office needs for the scheme to function.

While offseason grades come with the obvious caveat — games decide reputations — the early praise for the Chargers and Eagles highlights a reality NFL fans know well: coordinator hires can change a season faster than most roster moves. The next measuring stick will come as each staff installs its system in the spring and summer, with training camp and preseason offering the first clues about whether a “home run” hire and a long-sought play-caller translate into points, stops and, ultimately, wins.The NFL’s annual coordinator carousel rarely produces immediate consensus, but CBS Sports’ early grades on the latest wave of hires underscored a clear theme: teams are doubling down on specialized play-calling and schematic fit, with the Los Angeles Chargers and Philadelphia Eagles drawing the strongest early marks for moves designed to change the trajectory of their offenses.
