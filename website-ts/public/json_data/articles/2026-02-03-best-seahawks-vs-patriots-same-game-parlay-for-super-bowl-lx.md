With Super Bowl LX setting up a Seahawks-Patriots matchup, the betting market has already turned part of the week’s conversation away from legacy and toward value — and one unlikely name is being pushed to the front of the props board. Yahoo Sports NFL contributor Josh Inglis, in an article focused on same-game parlay options for Seattle vs. New England, spotlighted wide receiver Mack Hollins as a “surprising value” play in Super Bowl 60 prop bets, a notable turn for a player who rarely sits at the center of championship-week attention.

Inglis’ angle reflects how modern Super Bowl coverage has expanded beyond the headline stars to include role players whose usage can swing a game — or a wager — on a few snaps. Same-game parlays, which bundle multiple outcomes from a single contest into one bet, have become a focal point of Super Bowl week for many fans. Inglis’ Seahawks-Patriots parlay framework leans into that idea by hunting for edges in the player-prop market, where reception totals, yardage marks and anytime-touchdown outcomes can amplify interest even for viewers who do not typically track betting lines.

Hollins’ inclusion underscores the broader dynamic of championship football, when matchups tighten and teams often need production outside their most obvious options. The Yahoo Sports NFL piece positioned Hollins as a potential value target among Super Bowl LX propositions, implying his price in the market may not fully capture his possible involvement. While Inglis’ write-up centered on the betting approach rather than a traditional scouting report, the premise is familiar: a player who can impact special teams, run a specific set of routes, or benefit from defensive attention elsewhere can suddenly become relevant on the sport’s biggest stage.

The Seahawks and Patriots, two franchises with deep postseason histories, have not been paired in this Super Bowl, but the setup naturally invites comparisons to prior eras and past title-game trends — including the way Super Bowls often turn on one or two unexpected contributions. For fans, that is part of the appeal: props and parlays provide a lens for dissecting how a game might unfold beyond the final score, while also shining a light on names who are otherwise easy to overlook in star-driven coverage.

As Super Bowl week continues, the storylines will broaden from early betting angles to injuries, game plans and matchup specifics. Still, Inglis’ Hollins-centered value call serves as an early reminder of what typically decides championships — not just the marquee players, but the secondary pieces who find a moment when it matters most.With Super Bowl LX setting up a Seahawks-Patriots matchup, the betting market has already turned part of the week’s conversation away from legacy and toward value — and one unlikely name is being pushed to the front of the props board.
