Sam Darnold is no longer trying to explain away what went wrong with the New York Jets or Carolina Panthers. With time and a stabilizing stint in Seattle behind him, the former high draft pick is framing those earlier failures as necessary steps rather than defining labels — a shift in tone that underscores how quickly an NFL quarterback’s reputation can change with the right environment.

Now several years removed from his time with the Jets and Panthers, Darnold said he looks back on the struggles in those stops as “part of my journey,” according to Yahoo Sports. The comment reflects a quarterback who has lived both extremes of the league’s development curve: the early expectation of a franchise savior, followed by the churn that often comes when a young passer is asked to carry unstable situations, and then the reprieve of landing in a more functional setting.

Darnold entered the NFL with the Jets and later moved on to the Panthers, two tenures that became synonymous with stalled promise and organizational transition. For fans, those chapters helped cement the idea that Darnold might never match the expectations that accompanied his entry into the league. But his recent experience with the Seahawks offered a different lens, one that appears to have allowed him to reassess what those previous years meant — and what they did not.

That reframe matters in a league that routinely reduces quarterback evaluation to wins, losses and highlight reels. Darnold’s perspective suggests that context — coaching continuity, roster construction and the degree of pressure placed on a young quarterback — can shape outcomes as much as raw talent. His Seattle success, as characterized by Yahoo Sports, has given him room to treat the Jets and Panthers years less as a verdict and more as a foundation.

For the Seahawks, Darnold’s renewed confidence and maturity carry practical value, too. A quarterback who has seen the worst of NFL instability and come out with a steadier outlook can be a stabilizing presence in a room that, like many around the league, is constantly assessing the position’s future.

The next steps will determine whether Darnold’s recalibrated narrative becomes permanent. What to watch is whether he can translate that “fresh perspective” into sustained performance and leadership, the kind that turns a former cautionary tale into a viable long-term option in a league that rarely offers quarterbacks many chances to rewrite their story.Sam Darnold is no longer trying to explain away what went wrong with the New York Jets or Carolina Panthers.
