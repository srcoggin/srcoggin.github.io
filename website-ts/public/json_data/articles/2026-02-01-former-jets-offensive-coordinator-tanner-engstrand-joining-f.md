**Category:** Coaching News

Former New York Jets offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand is swiftly finding a new home in the NFL coaching ranks, reportedly joining the Atlanta Falcons' staff just days after parting ways with the Jets. The move signals another step in the Falcons' ongoing process of assembling their new coaching contingent under head coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson.

Engstrand's departure from the Jets earlier in the week marked a quick turnaround for the coach, who had served as a key figure on their offensive staff. While the exact circumstances of his exit from New York were not detailed, coaching changes often follow periods of team evaluation and strategic shifts. The Jets' offense has faced considerable scrutiny in recent seasons, experiencing various challenges that led to a desire for new perspectives and approaches. Engstrand's background as an offensive coordinator, even if his tenure in that specific role with the Jets was brief or recent, adds an experienced mind to the Falcons' burgeoning offensive brain trust.

Engstrand's experience, particularly with offensive game planning and player development, could be a valuable asset as Robinson crafts his system.

In the NFL, the offseason is a critical period for coaches to mesh, develop a shared philosophy, and lay the groundwork for a cohesive unit. Bringing
