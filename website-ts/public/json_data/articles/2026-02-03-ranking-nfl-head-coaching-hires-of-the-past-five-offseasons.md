The NFL’s relentless coaching carousel has delivered five offseasons of head-coach hires since 2021, and the league’s competitive balance — from rapid turnarounds to prolonged rebuilds — can often be traced back to which franchises got those decisions right. ESPN’s Bill Barnwell attempted to quantify those outcomes this week, ranking 37 head-coaching hires made over the past five hiring cycles and using on-field results as the clearest separator in a league where patience is rare and expectations are immediate.

Barnwell’s exercise, published by ESPN, frames the discussion around a simple question with complicated variables: Which hires have actually worked since 2021? The list runs 1 through 37, covering the full range of recent coaching decisions — from splashy, veteran retreads to first-time head coaches tasked with modernizing offenses, developing young quarterbacks and establishing culture in dysfunctional situations.

The ranking also places renewed emphasis on the ultimate measuring stick in the sport: postseason performance and the ability to sustain it. Barnwell’s story points directly to the current Super Bowl coaching matchup as a benchmark for success, asking “how do the Super Bowl coaches stack up?” That matters because, across the league, front offices increasingly hire with January in mind, not merely a marginal improvement in win totals. The teams that find a coach capable of building a program — not just installing a scheme — tend to separate quickly, and their success ripples through the league as copycat candidates rise and fall on hiring boards.

The past five offseasons have also coincided with a quarterback-development era that has changed what owners and general managers want from the position. The league has seen an influx of offensive-minded hires in recent cycles, reflecting the premium placed on maximizing rookie-contract windows at quarterback and adapting weekly to evolving defensive trends. Barnwell’s ranking underscores that the best hires are typically those that align roster timelines, quarterback trajectories and organizational patience — while also translating that plan into results on Sundays.

For fans, the list provides a snapshot of where franchises stand in the long game. Coaching hires are among the few decisions that can reshape a team’s identity within a season or two, but they also can lock an organization into years of scheme fit issues, uneven player development and constant coordinator turnover.

With another hiring cycle always looming, Barnwell’s 1-37 ordering serves as both a scoreboard and a warning. The league’s next wave of candidates will be evaluated against the recent hires that delivered — and the ones that didn’t — with the Super Bowl sideline again providing the clearest reminder of what the right coach can mean in today’s NFL.The NFL’s relentless coaching carousel has delivered five offseasons of head-coach hires since 2021, and the league’s competitive balance — from rapid turnarounds to prolonged rebuilds — can often be traced back to which franchises got those decisions right.
