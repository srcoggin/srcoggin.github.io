The Las Vegas Raiders are expected to move quickly to stabilize a franchise that has cycled through coaches and offensive plans in recent seasons, with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak emerging as the choice to lead the next reset. The Raiders are expected to hire Kubiak as their next head coach after the Super Bowl, sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter, signaling that Las Vegas is targeting an offensive-minded leader with recent play-calling experience and a familiar NFL coaching lineage.

The timing is significant. By waiting until after the Super Bowl, the Raiders position themselves to complete the process in the league’s usual post-championship window while also aligning their offseason program around a clear coaching vision. For a roster that has struggled to find consistent identity, particularly on offense, the decision to pursue Kubiak underscores an organizational priority: modernizing the attack and developing a sustainable system rather than patching together short-term fixes.

Kubiak currently serves as the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, a role that places him at the center of weekly game planning, quarterback development and overall offensive structure. In a league increasingly driven by schematic flexibility and quarterback-friendly systems, teams have leaned toward hiring coaches with offensive backgrounds, and the Raiders’ expected move fits that broader trend. For Las Vegas, it is also a bet on a coach whose resume has been built inside NFL rooms rather than on the college pipeline, a factor that can matter when managing pro-level staff dynamics and roster decisions.

The Raiders’ interest in Kubiak also reflects the realities of the AFC landscape. With elite quarterbacks and high-powered offenses dominating the conference, Las Vegas has faced pressure to keep pace not only with divisional competition but also with the broader playoff field. Hiring a head coach tied directly to offensive planning can shape everything from free agency priorities to how the team evaluates its quarterback situation and builds around it.

The next steps are expected to hinge on finalizing an agreement once the Super Bowl concludes, per ESPN’s report. Until then, the league’s annual coaching carousel continues to reshape the competitive map, with the Raiders’ anticipated hire representing one of the offseason’s most consequential dominoes. For fans, the immediate focus will be what Kubiak’s arrival would mean for the coaching staff, the offensive scheme and the franchise’s long-term direction as the Raiders attempt to turn another fresh start into real traction.The Las Vegas Raiders are expected to move quickly to stabilize a franchise that has cycled through coaches and offensive plans in recent seasons, with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak emerging as the choice to lead the next reset.
