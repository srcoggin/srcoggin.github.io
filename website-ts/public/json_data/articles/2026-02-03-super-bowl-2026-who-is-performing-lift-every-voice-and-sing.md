Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks is getting its pregame soundtrack into focus, with CBS Sports detailing the musical lineup for two of the ceremony’s signature performances: “America the Beautiful” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” The selections matter because, long before the opening kickoff, the NFL’s biggest stage is defined by its presentation — and the pregame set pieces routinely become some of the most watched and discussed moments of Super Bowl Sunday.

CBS Sports’ Super Bowl 2026 coverage highlighted who will handle “America the Beautiful” ahead of Patriots vs. Seahawks, positioning the performance as a prominent part of the league’s Super Bowl pageantry. The song has become a staple of the pregame schedule, serving as a final scene-setter before the game’s on-field intensity takes over. With millions watching, the performer is often treated as a headliner in the event’s opening act, bridging the entertainment and sports audiences that the Super Bowl uniquely attracts.

CBS Sports also reported on who will perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing” ahead of Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl LX. The song has become an established component of the pregame program in recent years, and its inclusion continues to draw attention because it reflects the league’s broader effort to present a ceremony that resonates beyond the fan bases of the two teams on the field. Like “America the Beautiful,” the performance is tightly choreographed and timed, offering a nationally televised moment that adds to the gravitas of the occasion.

The matchup itself underscores why the league’s pregame presentation lands with such impact. The Patriots and Seahawks are two of the NFL’s most recognizable franchises, and the Super Bowl audience extends far beyond traditional football viewership. That makes each pregame segment — from anthem-adjacent songs to other on-field ceremonies — part of the Super Bowl’s brand, not just a warmup to the game.

For NFL fans, the announcements are another sign that Super Bowl week is moving from speculation to schedule. Attention will now turn to the rest of the pregame and halftime slate, as well as how the league structures its on-field ceremonies around a Patriots-Seahawks championship stage. As CBS Sports continues rolling out details, the full picture of Super Bowl LX’s presentation — and the moments that could trend right alongside the game’s biggest plays — will come into sharper view.Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks is getting its pregame soundtrack into focus, with CBS Sports detailing the musical lineup for two of the ceremony’s signature performances: “America the Beautiful” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” The selections matter because, long before the opening kickoff, the NFL’s biggest stage is defined by its presentation — and the pregame set pieces routinely become some of the most watched and discussed moments of Super Bowl Sunday.
