The New York Jets took a notable step in their search for an offensive coordinator Monday night, completing in-person, second-round interviews with Darrell Bevell and Greg Roman, the team announced. The move signals the process is narrowing and underscores the urgency for a franchise trying to stabilize its offensive identity with a staff hire that can reshape weekly game plans and, potentially, the direction of the roster.

The Jets’ announcement confirmed both Bevell and Roman advanced to the second-interview stage, an indication each remains a serious contender for a job that will carry outsized importance in New York. Offensive coordinator hires often set the tone for a team’s quarterback development, protection schemes and overall tempo, and the Jets’ decision-makers appear to be digging deeper on two candidates with extensive NFL experience and distinct stylistic profiles.

Bevell has been a long-time offensive coach in the league, frequently associated with quarterback-centric systems and varied game planning across multiple stops. Roman, meanwhile, has built a reputation around run-oriented approaches and creative rushing designs. By bringing both candidates back for in-person meetings, the Jets are continuing a process that typically goes beyond surface-level philosophy and into staffing plans, terminology, teaching methods and how a coordinator would build an offense week-to-week against specific opponents.

The second interviews also suggest the Jets are prioritizing fit and clarity at a critical post. Offensive coordinators are tasked with installing scheme, calling plays and bridging the gap between coaching vision and on-field execution. For fans, this stage of the search matters because it provides the clearest signal yet of the offensive direction the Jets may take — whether they lean toward a more traditional passing structure, a heavier run-game foundation, or some combination tailored to their personnel.

The Jets’ statement Monday night did not indicate a timeline for a final decision or whether additional candidates will receive second interviews. Still, the completion of in-person meetings with Bevell and Roman positions the club to move toward a conclusion in the coming days, with the next development likely to be either another round of interviews or a hire.

For now, the focus remains on what comes next: whether the Jets quickly close the process after these meetings or continue to widen the net. Either way, the choice will shape the offseason program and provide the blueprint for how New York intends to operate offensively when the next season begins.The New York Jets took a notable step in their search for an offensive coordinator Monday night, completing in-person, second-round interviews with Darrell Bevell and Greg Roman, the team announced.
