Super Bowl week in San Francisco is typically dominated by matchup talk and legacy debates, but a draft-centric message cut through the noise in a Yahoo Sports NFL live show: the next wave of contenders is likely to be built the way the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks got here — with a clear team-building blueprint and a draft plan that matches it.

In a special fantasy-focused podcast broadcast live from San Francisco during Super Bowl LX week, Yahoo Sports’ Matt Harmon and Nate Tice used the two participating franchises as case studies. The show framed the Patriots and Seahawks as examples of organizations that followed a definable “path” to the sport’s biggest stage, then challenged other teams to borrow from those models as they turn toward the 2026 offseason and the NFL Draft.

That discussion carried added weight because it arrived at the moment the league calendar pivots. With the Super Bowl serving as the unofficial hinge point between the season that was and the roster building ahead, front offices and fan bases alike begin shifting focus to free agency, the salary cap puzzle and the draft. The Yahoo Sports segment placed the draft at the center of that conversation, arguing that the Super Bowl participants offer a reminder that personnel decisions need to be connected — from overall roster construction to how specific skill players fit within a team’s identity.

The second half of the show moved from big-picture philosophy to draft execution, with Harmon and Tice walking through Tice’s “Mock Draft 1.0.” While the discussion was rooted in fantasy football angles, the analysis leaned heavily on how offensive skill players might translate to the next level and which team environments could maximize them. Harmon and Tice also “did a deep dive” on fit, emphasizing that a prospect’s value is often shaped by usage, surrounding talent and scheme — a point that resonates far beyond fantasy projections.

For NFL fans, the significance is straightforward: Super Bowl week is not just a celebration of two teams, but a window into what works. As Harmon and Tice framed it, the Patriots’ and Seahawks’ rise underscores that replicable paths exist — and that the teams drafting in April can shorten the climb if they marry evaluation with a coherent plan.

As Super Bowl LX approaches, the immediate focus remains on the game. But the broader takeaway from San Francisco is already aimed at the weeks to come: as Tice’s early mock draft cycle begins, the next contenders will be shaped not only by who they select, but by whether their picks align with a blueprint sturdy enough to reach the NFL’s biggest stage.Super Bowl week in San Francisco is typically dominated by matchup talk and legacy debates, but a draft-centric message cut through the noise in a Yahoo Sports NFL live show: the next wave of contenders is likely to be built the way the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks got here — with a clear team-building blueprint and a draft plan that matches it.
