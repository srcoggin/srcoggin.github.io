John Harbaugh is beginning to shape the New York Giants’ staff with a familiar NFL blueprint: stabilizing the offense by leaning on experienced play-callers. According to Pro Football Talk, the Giants’ new head coach is considering former NFL head coaches Brian Callahan and Kliff Kingsbury for the team’s offensive coordinator vacancy, an early signal that Harbaugh wants a proven hand to oversee a unit that will be central to New York’s attempt to climb back into contention.

The Giants’ coordinator search carries added weight because it will define the identity of Harbaugh’s first season in charge. Harbaugh, who arrived as a high-profile hire, is installing a new staff and a new structure. The offense, in particular, becomes the clearest on-field reflection of that transition — from quarterback development and scheme to weekly game planning and in-game adjustments. Bringing in a former head coach as offensive coordinator typically offers a franchise a ready-made framework: someone who has managed an entire operation, coordinated staffs and handled the pressure of building an offense around a roster’s strengths.

Callahan and Kingsbury each bring distinct résumés that could shape the direction of Harbaugh’s Giants. Callahan has served in offensive leadership roles and has been a prominent name in recent coordinator and head-coaching cycles. Kingsbury is known around the league for his offensive background and for his time leading an NFL team, experience that could appeal to a first-year Giants staff seeking both innovation and a steady hand.

The potential pursuit of either candidate also underscores a broader league trend: head coaches, even those with strong leadership pedigrees, often prefer to pair themselves with coordinators who can run one side of the ball with autonomy. For Harbaugh, that approach could allow him to focus on the full team operation — game management, culture, staff oversight and situational football — while delegating the weekly burden of building and calling an offense to a coordinator with prior top-job experience.

No hire is imminent, and the Giants’ search could include additional candidates. Still, the names under consideration highlight the kind of staff Harbaugh appears intent on assembling — one built on experience and credibility. The next step will be whether New York can land one of its targets and, if so, how that coordinator’s scheme and staff choices ripple through the roster and offseason planning. For Giants fans, the coordinator decision will be an early tell on how quickly Harbaugh believes the offense can be rebuilt — and what style of football the franchise plans to play moving forward.John Harbaugh is beginning to shape the New York Giants’ staff with a familiar NFL blueprint: stabilizing the offense by leaning on experienced play-callers.
