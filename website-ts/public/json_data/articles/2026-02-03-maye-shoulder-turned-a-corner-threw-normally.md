Patriots quarterback Drake Maye offered New England its clearest sign yet that its Super Bowl plans remain intact, saying his right throwing shoulder has “turned a corner” and that he was able to throw normally in practice Monday as the club begins its final preparations for Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.

Maye, who injured the shoulder in the AFC Championship Game, told reporters he took his normal number of throws during the Patriots’ first on-field work of the week. The update is significant for a New England team built around Maye’s ability to drive the ball and threaten defenses at every level, and it comes with Super Bowl week pressure intensifying as every rep is scrutinized and every health update shapes game planning.

According to ESPN NFL, Maye’s evaluation of his progress marked a notable shift from the immediate post-championship uncertainty, when the Patriots faced a short turnaround and a sport’s biggest stage with their most important player managing a throwing-side injury. By Monday, Maye indicated the recovery trendline had improved enough for him to operate without restrictions in the portions of practice available for observation, saying the shoulder has “turned a corner.”

The Patriots will continue to monitor Maye’s workload and recovery as they move through the week, but his ability to handle his typical throwing volume in an early-week session is a key checkpoint. It also provides coaching staff and teammates a level of stability as they install the plan for Seattle — particularly with timing-based elements of the offense that are difficult to replicate when a quarterback’s mechanics are compromised.

For fans, the development matters because quarterback health often determines how aggressive a team can be in a Super Bowl. A compromised throwing shoulder can affect velocity, accuracy and the willingness to attack tight windows, potentially narrowing the playbook and altering how defenses respond. Maye’s description of a normal throwing day suggests New England can proceed with its preferred approach rather than shifting into contingency mode.

The Patriots still have multiple practices ahead before facing the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, and the week will bring continued evaluation as intensity increases. What to watch now is whether Maye stacks another full throwing day without setback and maintains his normal routine as the Patriots move closer to kickoff with their quarterback signaling he is trending the right way at the most important moment of the season.Patriots quarterback Drake Maye offered New England its clearest sign yet that its Super Bowl plans remain intact, saying his right throwing shoulder has “turned a corner” and that he was able to throw normally in practice Monday as the club begins its final preparations for Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.
