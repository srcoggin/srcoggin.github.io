The New York Giants’ search for an offensive coordinator has hit an early snag, with one of their reported candidates coming off the board. Davis Webb, a former Giants quarterback who had emerged as a contender for the vacancy, is instead taking the offensive coordinator job with the Denver Broncos, according to Yahoo Sports NFL.

Webb’s move matters because it removes a familiar name from a Giants process that is central to the franchise’s near-term direction. The team is looking to reshape its offense and identify a play-caller capable of stabilizing a unit that has struggled for consistency. Webb’s candidacy also carried an element of continuity: He previously spent time in New York as a quarterback, giving him firsthand familiarity with the organization and its market, even as his coaching career has progressed elsewhere.

The Broncos’ decision to hire Webb as offensive coordinator underscores how quickly the coaching carousel can accelerate once jobs open and interviews begin. For New York, it is a reminder that coordinator searches rarely unfold in a straight line, particularly when candidates are attractive to multiple teams. When a candidate accepts an offensive coordinator role elsewhere, it not only narrows the pool but can also reshape the timing and urgency of subsequent interviews, especially as staffs begin to fill out across the league.

Webb’s departure from the Giants’ candidate list is notable because it reflects the kind of competition teams face when they prioritize offensive innovation and quarterback development. Even without detailing the full range of candidates still under consideration, the development signals that the Giants will need to recalibrate as they work through the next stage of their search. The offensive coordinator hire is among the most consequential decisions for any club, shaping weekly game plans, in-game adjustments and — most importantly — the trajectory of the quarterback position and supporting cast.

For Broncos fans, Webb’s promotion marks a significant step for a coach whose playing career included a stint in New York. For Giants fans, it’s a concrete reminder that the team’s offseason rebuild isn’t limited to roster moves; it starts with who will call plays and set the offensive identity.

With Webb now headed to Denver, the Giants’ focus turns fully to the remaining options to lead their offense. The next hire will offer the clearest signal yet of the team’s preferred scheme, the type of quarterback development plan it wants to prioritize and how quickly it believes it can turn offensive performance into wins.The New York Giants’ search for an offensive coordinator has hit an early snag, with one of their reported candidates coming off the board.
