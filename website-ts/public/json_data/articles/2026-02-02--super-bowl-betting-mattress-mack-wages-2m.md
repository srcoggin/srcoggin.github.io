The Super Bowl is still days away, but one of its most recognizable side shows already has a headliner again. Houston furniture salesman Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale, long known for turning championship games into seven-figure wagers, has placed $2 million on the New England Patriots to win the Super Bowl, according to ESPN NFL.

The size of the bet is significant even in an era when legal sports wagering has pushed Super Bowl betting into the mainstream. McIngvale’s stakes routinely stand apart because they are both personal spectacle and a barometer of public confidence. A $2 million position on the Patriots is not just a prediction; it’s a public declaration that New England remains the franchise he is willing to back with the biggest money possible on the sport’s biggest stage.

McIngvale has built a national profile on extravagant, headline-grabbing bets tied to high-profile events, and the Super Bowl has been a recurring platform for that brand. His willingness to put millions behind a single outcome has turned him into a familiar name to NFL fans far beyond Houston, especially each winter when betting interest peaks. ESPN reported that this latest wager is $2 million on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.

For the Patriots, the bet reinforces how New England continues to occupy a unique place in the league’s modern imagination. Even among fans who do not wager, the Super Bowl has become a weeklong referendum on confidence, narratives and legacy — and big bets like McIngvale’s often serve as shorthand for where belief is landing. When a gambler with a long history of high-stakes swings publicly plants his flag, it becomes part of the conversation around a game that already carries enormous pressure and attention.

The money also underscores the scale of the Super Bowl betting economy and why it matters to the league’s audience. Betting has become another way fans engage with the event, from casual picks to wagers that draw national headlines. In that environment, McIngvale’s bet functions like a spotlight: It amplifies the Patriots’ presence in the matchup and adds a high-dollar storyline to a week built on them.

As kickoff approaches, the focus will return to matchups, coaching decisions and execution under Super Bowl pressure. Still, McIngvale’s $2 million wager ensures that, alongside the on-field stakes, the Patriots will carry one of the week’s most prominent off-field endorsements — and a reminder that for some, the Super Bowl is a game measured in far more than points.The Super Bowl is still days away, but one of its most recognizable side shows already has a headliner again.
