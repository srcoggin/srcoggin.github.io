Mike Vrabel has heard the chatter that the New England Patriots are headed into Super Bowl LX as the underdog, and he is not treating it as a storyline that will move the needle inside the locker room.

With the Seattle Seahawks installed as the favorite, Vrabel dismissed the idea that the betting market’s view carries any meaning for how the Patriots prepare or perform on the game’s biggest stage. “That’s not anything that’s ever affected us,” Vrabel said of the Seahawks being favored in Super Bowl LX, according to remarks carried by Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk. When pressed on New England’s role in the matchup, Vrabel added a blunt summary of the dynamic: “Somebody has to.”

Vrabel’s comments frame the Patriots’ approach in the final lead-up to the championship as one rooted in routine rather than reaction. The Super Bowl is often accompanied by a week of narratives — who has the hotter quarterback, which coaching staff has the schematic edge, how a team handles the spotlight — and the point spread can become a proxy for those debates. Vrabel, though, made clear he is not interested in letting outside expectations seep into his team’s focus, a message that matters for a Patriots club that has been around high-stakes football long enough to understand how quickly distractions can multiply.

Seattle’s status as the favorite adds another layer to the week’s conversation, but Vrabel’s history suggests he prefers to strip preparation down to controllables: practice habits, situational football and the ability to execute under pressure. His insistence that the underdog label “hasn’t ever affected” his team functions as a reminder of how coaches often try to insulate players from the noise, whether it comes from talk shows, social media or Las Vegas.

For fans, Vrabel’s stance matters because it hints at how New England plans to manage the emotional swings that can come with being doubted publicly. Some teams embrace the underdog identity as fuel; others treat it as meaningless. Vrabel’s words point toward the latter. By refusing to play into the narrative, he is signaling that New England’s confidence is not dependent on external validation, favorable odds or public perception.

The Patriots and Seahawks still have to decide the game on the field, and the coming days will determine whether Vrabel’s message translates into the calm, sharp execution that typically wins in February. As kickoff nears, the focus will remain on whether New England can keep the week as businesslike as Vrabel’s quotes suggest — and whether Seattle can justify its favored status when the lights are brightest.Mike Vrabel has heard the chatter that the New England Patriots are headed into Super Bowl LX as the underdog, and he is not treating it as a storyline that will move the needle inside the locker room.
