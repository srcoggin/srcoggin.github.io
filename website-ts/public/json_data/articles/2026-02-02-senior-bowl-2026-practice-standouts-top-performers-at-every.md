Three days of Senior Bowl practices in Mobile, Alabama, offered the NFL’s first extended, up-close look at many of the top draft-eligible seniors for 2026 — and, as CBS Sports NFL noted in its roundup of practice standouts, the week quickly became a separator for players who looked ready for the league’s next step. With evaluators from across the NFL on hand and roster needs already being mapped out months before the 2025 season even kicks off, strong work in one-on-ones and team periods carried real weight for prospects trying to turn “intriguing” into “priority.”

CBS Sports identified a group of “biggest winners” from the practices, headlined by Lee Hunter and Malachi Fields. While the Senior Bowl game itself traditionally caps the week, scouting departments often treat the practice sessions as the main event. They provide repeated reps against comparable competition, particularly in the one-on-one drills that can stress-test traits that are harder to confirm on college tape — a pass rusher’s ability to win quickly, an offensive lineman’s anchor and recovery, or a receiver’s skill separating against NFL-style coverage.

That is why the list of standouts “at every position” matters for both fans and front offices. Prospects who consistently stack quality reps in Mobile can change the way teams slot them on early boards, especially at premium positions where the league spends heavily in free agency and tends to prioritize cost-controlled rookie contracts in the draft. A strong Senior Bowl week can also help clarify evaluations that might be clouded by scheme, level of competition or inconsistent supporting casts at the college level.

The practices also serve a broader purpose: They are among the rare settings where prospects meet teams in volume, operate in pro-style installs and show how quickly they absorb coaching. For quarterbacks and pass catchers, it is a chance to build timing in a condensed timeframe. For linemen, it is an opportunity to show technique under the eyes of decision-makers who care as much about repeatability as flash.

The next checkpoints will come quickly. Prospects who popped in Mobile will be scrutinized again as the process moves toward the spring’s all-star circuit aftermath, the NFL scouting combine and pro days, where measurements, testing and interviews can either confirm what scouts saw on the field or force a recheck. For now, the early message from Mobile was clear: players like Hunter and Fields used the week to put themselves firmly into the 2026 draft conversation — and with it, onto the radar of fan bases already looking toward the league’s next wave of difference-makers.Three days of Senior Bowl practices in Mobile, Alabama, offered the NFL’s first extended, up-close look at many of the top draft-eligible seniors for 2026 — and, as CBS Sports NFL noted in its roundup of practice standouts, the week quickly became a separator for players who looked ready for the league’s next step.
