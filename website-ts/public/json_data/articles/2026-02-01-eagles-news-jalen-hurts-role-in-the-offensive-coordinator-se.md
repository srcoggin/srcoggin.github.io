# Eagles News: Jalen Hurts’ role in the offensive coordinator search was reportedly “minimal at best”

**Category:** Coaching News

Philadelphia, PA – As the Philadelphia Eagles continue their crucial search for a new offensive coordinator, a recent report indicates that franchise quarterback Jalen Hurts’ involvement in the process has been “minimal at best.” This development, reported on January 31, 2026, by Yahoo Sports NFL, raises questions about the organizational approach to one of the team’s most vital hires, particularly given Hurts' stature and significant role in the Eagles' offense.

The search for an offensive coordinator comes at a pivotal time for the Eagles, who are looking to rebound after a season that presumably fell short of expectations, necessitating a change in offensive leadership. For a team built around its high-performing quarterback, the selection of an offensive coordinator is paramount, as this individual will be directly responsible for designing the playbook, calling plays, and working intimately with Hurts to maximize his potential.

Typically, franchise quarterbacks, especially those with multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts and MVP-caliber seasons under their belt, are afforded significant input into such a crucial coaching decision. Their perspective on scheme fit, coaching philosophy, and personal working relationships is often considered invaluable by team management and head coaches. The report that Hurts' role has been "minimal at best" suggests a different operational dynamic, implying that the decision-making power rests almost entirely with the front office and head coach, with less direct consultation from their star signal-caller.

This approach could signal a clear organizational philosophy emphasizing top-down control over coaching hires, or it could simply reflect a specific stage in the interview process where player input is not yet solicited. However, for a quarterback who has been the undisputed leader of the offense and a critical voice in the locker room, a "minimal" role in selecting his primary offensive strategist is noteworthy. It could have implications for how the new coordinator integrates into the team and how Hurts adapts to a system he may not have had a direct hand in shaping.

As the Eagles progress in their search, all eyes will be on the eventual hire and the offensive direction they usher in. While the team aims to find the right leader to revitalize its attack, the reported limited involvement of Jalen Hurts in the process will undoubtedly be a point of discussion among fans and analysts eager to see how this crucial decision impacts the future success of the Philadelphia Eagles.
