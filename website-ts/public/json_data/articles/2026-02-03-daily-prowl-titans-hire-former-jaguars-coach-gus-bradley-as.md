The Tennessee Titans are turning to a familiar name to reshape their defense, hiring former Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley as defensive coordinator, according to a Yahoo Sports NFL report. The move pairs an experienced, long-tenured defensive voice with a Titans franchise searching for answers after a turbulent cycle of coaching changes and inconsistent defensive play, and it adds another chapter to Bradley’s AFC South history.

Bradley’s arrival is notable not only because of his résumé but also because of where he built his most prominent head-coaching profile. He previously led the Jaguars, giving him deep familiarity with the division’s rivalries, personnel trends and offensive systems that regularly circulate through the AFC South. For Tennessee, that division context matters: the Titans’ path back to contention is tethered to navigating a schedule heavy with familiar opponents, and the team is clearly betting that a coach who has lived inside the division’s week-to-week grind can accelerate the transition.

Yahoo Sports described the hiring as Tennessee bringing in the “former Jaguars coach” to run its defense, a concise framing that underscores the significance of the decision. Defensive coordinator hires are often less splashy than head-coaching moves, but they can carry outsized impact, especially for a team trying to establish a clear identity. Bradley’s track record — and his association with a distinct defensive approach over multiple stops — suggests the Titans are aiming for a more defined structure and terminology, one that can be taught quickly and sustained year over year.

The hire also fits the broader reality of how NFL coaching cycles work: when teams change direction, coordinators with head-coaching experience are often prioritized because they have run entire programs, managed staff dynamics and handled game-day decision-making under pressure. For Tennessee, adding a coordinator who has already navigated those challenges reduces the guesswork, particularly at a time when the Titans will be evaluating personnel fits and long-term roster construction.

The Titans’ decision reverberates beyond Tennessee. Bradley’s history with Jacksonville gives the move an immediate AFC South edge, and it also provides a clear storyline when the Titans and Jaguars meet. Those matchups will now feature a defensive coordinator who knows the organization, the market and the stakes — and will be tasked with translating that familiarity into stops.

What comes next will be telling. How quickly Bradley installs his system, how the Titans build around it in the offseason, and how the defense responds early in the season will determine whether this hire is a stabilizing step or simply the next turn in a franchise still searching for footing.The Tennessee Titans are turning to a familiar name to reshape their defense, hiring former Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley as defensive coordinator, according to a Yahoo Sports NFL report.
