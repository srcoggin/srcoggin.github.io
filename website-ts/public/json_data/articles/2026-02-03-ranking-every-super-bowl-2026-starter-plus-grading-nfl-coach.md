CBS Sports’ NFL notebook for Feb. 2 cast a wide net across the league’s biggest forward-looking story lines, offering a snapshot of how the sport is being shaped as much by decisions on the sideline as by the stars expected to start in Super Bowl 2026. The roundup paired a ranking of projected Super Bowl starters with an evaluation of the NFL’s most recent coaching hires and an early 2026 mock draft — a combination that underscored a central reality of the modern league: roster-building and coaching alignment are increasingly inseparable.

The Super Bowl 2026 starter exercise, as framed by CBS Sports, was less about predicting a specific matchup than about emphasizing the premium the NFL places on top-end, every-down talent in January football. By ranking starters in a hypothetical Super Bowl lineup, the piece highlighted the way championship contenders are typically defined by elite quarterback play, difference-making skill-position talent and defensive players who can tilt a game without schematic assistance. For fans, the significance is straightforward: when the playoffs compress margins, the teams that reach the final weekend tend to be the ones with the most high-end starters who can win one-on-one matchups.

CBS Sports also turned its attention to the coaching carousel, grading recent hires with an eye toward fit, organizational timing and the expectation that staffs now must develop young quarterbacks quickly while installing adaptable systems. In a league where coaching changes can reshape a franchise’s direction in a single offseason, those evaluations served as an early barometer of which teams might be positioned to accelerate a rebuild — and which could be setting themselves up for another reset if early returns lag.

The inclusion of a 2026 mock draft pushed the horizon even further out, reinforcing the year-round nature of NFL roster management. Mock drafts this far in advance inevitably revolve around projecting team needs and the types of prospects likely to rise into the top of the board, but the exercise also reflected the league’s broader trend: front offices are planning multiple seasons ahead, particularly at premium positions where rookie contracts and long-term payroll planning can dictate a team’s competitive window.

Taken together, the CBS Sports package illustrated how quickly narratives form around coaching hires and future personnel decisions long before training camps open. With the league calendar moving from postseason reflection to offseason construction, the teams that marry coaching vision with high-end starter talent — and align that plan with future draft capital — will be the ones to watch as the path to Super Bowl 2026 begins to take shape.CBS Sports’ NFL notebook for Feb. 2 cast a wide net across the league’s biggest forward-looking story lines, offering a snapshot of how the sport is being shaped as much by decisions on the sideline as by the stars expected to start in Super Bowl 2026.
