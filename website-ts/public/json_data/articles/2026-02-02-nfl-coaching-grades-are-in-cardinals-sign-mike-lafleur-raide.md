The NFL’s annual coaching carousel is already reshaping how several franchises envision their offenses in 2026 and beyond, and two of the most consequential moves are coming into focus in the NFC West and AFC West. The Arizona Cardinals have signed Mike LaFleur, while the Las Vegas Raiders are closing in on Klint Kubiak, according to CBS Sports’ roundup of coaching grades that examined the hires, the biggest risks and what each change could mean long-term.

Arizona’s decision to bring in LaFleur signals a clear commitment to refreshing its offensive approach with a coach who has been part of modern NFL systems. In a league increasingly defined by spacing, tempo and quarterback-friendly design, the Cardinals’ move matters because it touches the franchise’s most important variable: the direction of its offense and how efficiently it can function against the defenses it sees twice a year in a division that has recently been shaped by high-end coaching and creative schemes. CBS Sports framed the hiring cycle through the lens of both immediate fit and future sustainability, and Arizona’s addition of LaFleur fits that theme as a bet on an offensive voice who can help shape the team’s identity going forward.

In Las Vegas, the Raiders’ pursuit of Kubiak underscores how quickly teams move to secure coordinators viewed as capable of stabilizing — or redefining — an offense. CBS Sports reported the Raiders are closing in on Kubiak, a development that places the organization among the clubs seeking schematic clarity after a period of transition. In the AFC West, where game-planning and efficiency are often the difference between contention and chasing, the Raiders’ pending move carries significance for both weekly competitiveness and the broader arc of roster building. Scheme fit can influence everything from quarterback development to how a front office prioritizes linemen, pass-catchers and running backs.

CBS Sports’ larger coaching-grades package emphasized evaluating hires not just as splashy headlines, but as decisions that can ripple for years. Coordinator selections can dictate terminology, pace, personnel usage and the developmental track for young players, particularly at quarterback. That is why the LaFleur signing in Arizona and the Raiders’ proximity to a deal with Kubiak stand out: both suggest a strategic attempt to align coaching philosophy with long-term planning rather than simply patching a short-term problem.

As the league moves deeper into the offseason, the next markers will be staffing completions, scheme indicators and how each team’s personnel plans match its new play-caller’s preferences. For fans, the stakes are straightforward: coaching hires are often the first — and most revealing — clues about how Sundays will look months from now, and whether teams are building for a one-year bump or a multi-year rise.The NFL’s annual coaching carousel is already reshaping how several franchises envision their offenses in 2026 and beyond, and two of the most consequential moves are coming into focus in the NFC West and AFC West.
