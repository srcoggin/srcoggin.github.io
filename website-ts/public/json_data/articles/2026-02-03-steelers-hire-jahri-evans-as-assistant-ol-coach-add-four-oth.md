The Pittsburgh Steelers added a notable name — and a timely one — to their coaching staff, hiring former All-Pro guard Jahri Evans as assistant offensive line coach as part of a broader wave of assistant coaching additions. Evans is set to learn later this week whether he has been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but the move ensures he will have a new role for the 2026 season regardless of the outcome, according to Pro Football Talk.

The hire places Evans in a hands-on development position with one of the league’s most scrutinized position groups. In Pittsburgh, offensive line play is rarely a quiet topic, and the organization’s decision to bring in a recently retired, high-profile interior lineman signals an emphasis on teaching and technique as the team continues shaping its identity up front. Evans’ resume is central to the appeal: He is a former player with top-tier credentials, now transitioning into coaching at a franchise that has long leaned on continuity and line play as organizational pillars.

Evans’ arrival also intersects with one of the NFL calendar’s marquee moments for former players — the Hall of Fame announcement. Pro Football Talk noted Evans will find out later this week whether he has been elected, adding extra attention to what otherwise could have been a routine assistant-coaching move. For the Steelers, the timing creates a unique storyline: a coach joining the staff while potentially receiving the sport’s highest individual honor.

While Evans is the headliner, the Steelers’ changes were not limited to one position group. Pro Football Talk reported Pittsburgh added four other assistants as well, underscoring a broader effort to reshape and reinforce the staff entering the 2026 season. The cluster of hires suggests a purposeful refresh, especially in developmental roles that touch day-to-day practice work and the team’s long-term pipeline of contributors.

For fans, the significance is twofold. First, the Steelers are investing in the offensive line’s teaching infrastructure, a practical move that can affect everything from the run game to quarterback health. Second, bringing in an accomplished former lineman adds credibility in a room where technique, communication and trust often determine whether a unit becomes a strength or a weekly concern.

The immediate focus now shifts to two parallel tracks: the Hall of Fame decision involving Evans and how quickly he can translate his playing experience into coaching impact. With the Steelers adding multiple assistants, the coming months will reveal how the new pieces fit together — and whether Pittsburgh’s latest staff moves help lay the groundwork for a more consistent product in 2026.The Pittsburgh Steelers added a notable name — and a timely one — to their coaching staff, hiring former All-Pro guard Jahri Evans as assistant offensive line coach as part of a broader wave of assistant coaching additions.
