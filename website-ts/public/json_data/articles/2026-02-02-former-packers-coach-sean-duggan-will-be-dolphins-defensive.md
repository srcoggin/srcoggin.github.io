Jeff Hafley has settled one of the most important questions of his first offseason in Miami, choosing a familiar coaching hand to help shape the Dolphins’ defensive identity. Former Green Bay Packers coach Sean Duggan is set to become the Dolphins’ defensive coordinator, Yahoo Sports NFL reported, giving Hafley a non-play-calling partner to oversee the unit’s day-to-day operation and implement the system.

The move is significant not only because it fills a top job on Hafley’s staff, but because it clarifies how Miami intends to structure its defense under a new regime. According to Yahoo Sports, Hafley made his decision for a “non-play-calling defensive coordinator,” a key detail that signals Hafley intends to retain direct control over defensive play-calling while delegating coordinator-level responsibilities — from weekly game planning to staff organization and player development — to Duggan.

Duggan’s arrival ties Miami’s new approach to recent experience in Green Bay, where he coached under the Packers’ staff before moving on to this new role. For Dolphins players, that can mean a faster transition into a new system because coordinators often become the primary conduits between a head coach’s schematic vision and the position groups responsible for executing it on Sundays. For Miami, which is attempting to maximize its championship window in a league where small defensive improvements can swing close games, the staff fit matters as much as any splashy player acquisition.

Hafley’s decision also reflects a growing trend around the NFL, where head coaches — particularly those with a defensive background — increasingly keep the play sheet while hiring coordinators who can handle broader operational duties. In that model, the coordinator role becomes less about being the singular voice on game day and more about ensuring the defense’s week-to-week process is consistent, detailed and adaptable.

For Dolphins fans, the development offers an early look at Hafley’s priorities: a defense that is tightly aligned with the head coach’s game-day decision-making, supported by a coordinator trusted to manage the heavy lift of installation and preparation. How quickly that partnership translates into more consistent performance will be one of the defining questions of Miami’s offseason and training camp.

With the defensive coordinator spot filled, the next indicators will come in how the Dolphins finalize the rest of the defensive staff and how Hafley and Duggan divide responsibilities in practice. The clearest early test will arrive in camp, when Miami’s defense begins learning terminology, roles and adjustments — the foundation that often determines whether a unit peaks in December and January.Jeff Hafley has settled one of the most important questions of his first offseason in Miami, choosing a familiar coaching hand to help shape the Dolphins’ defensive identity.
