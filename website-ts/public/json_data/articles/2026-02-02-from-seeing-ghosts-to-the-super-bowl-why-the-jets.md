The arc from “seeing ghosts” to the Super Bowl has long been treated as a punch line in NFL circles, but those closest to Sam Darnold have framed it as something else entirely: a test of conviction. In an ESPN NFL account that revisited Darnold’s journey, former New York Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan and several of Darnold’s former teammates spoke openly — and at times emotionally — about why they never stopped believing the quarterback could eventually play on the sport’s biggest stage.

The “seeing ghosts” line, uttered during a nationally televised game early in Darnold’s career, became shorthand for a young quarterback overwhelmed by the moment. For years, it followed him as a defining snapshot of his time with the Jets, a franchise that has cycled through coaches and quarterbacks while searching for stability. What ESPN’s reporting underscores is how that moment also served as a pivot point in the minds of people who worked alongside Darnold: They viewed it not as a verdict on his ceiling, but as a temporary low in a longer developmental curve.

Maccagnan, the general manager who drafted Darnold, described a steady belief in the quarterback’s talent and makeup, according to ESPN. The story also leaned on recollections from former teammates, who spoke candidly about Darnold’s resilience and the way he carried himself through adversity. Their reflections were notable not only for their sincerity but also for their timing, as Darnold now stands one win from a championship that once felt impossibly distant.

For NFL fans, the significance stretches beyond one player’s redemption narrative. Quarterbacks are judged quickly, often permanently, on the worst moments captured on television. Darnold’s path, as told through the voices of decision-makers and peers, highlights the importance of patience, environment and organizational support — and how a career can be reshaped even after a widely mocked stumble.

The Jets’ connection to the story remains unavoidable. The franchise invested heavily in Darnold as a potential long-term answer, only to watch his tenure defined by uneven results and a rebuilding roster. ESPN’s reporting suggests that those inside the building never viewed him as lacking the tools to succeed, even when the public narrative turned harsh.

With the Super Bowl now in front of Darnold, the next chapter is no longer about reframing an old quote. It is about whether belief — the kind Maccagnan and former teammates said they maintained — can be validated on the game’s grandest stage, and what his performance might say about how quickly the NFL writes off young quarterbacks.The arc from “seeing ghosts” to the Super Bowl has long been treated as a punch line in NFL circles, but those closest to Sam Darnold have framed it as something else entirely: a test of conviction.
