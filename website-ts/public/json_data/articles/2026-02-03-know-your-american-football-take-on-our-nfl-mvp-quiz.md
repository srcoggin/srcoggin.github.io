With the NFL’s annual MVP debate already part of the league’s year-round ecosystem, Yahoo Sports is leaning into the enduring pull of the award with a new interactive challenge aimed at testing fans’ memory of recent pro football history. In a quiz published by Yahoo Sports NFL, readers are asked to identify every MVP winner dating back to 2000 — a stretch the outlet notes includes 25 MVPs — turning one of the sport’s most argued-over honors into a measuring stick for just how closely fans have followed the league over the last quarter-century.

The hook is simple: “Know your American football? Take on our NFL MVP quiz,” the piece reads, framing the award as both trivia and a snapshot of the NFL’s modern era. The quiz underscores the reality that MVP, more than most trophies in American sports, doubles as a shorthand for who defined a given season. The award typically follows production and team success, and it often becomes a proxy for larger conversations about roster construction, coaching impact and which styles of play are most valued in a given year.

Yahoo Sports’ framing — “There have been 25 MVP’s since the year 2000. How you many can you name?” — taps into the NFL’s unusually deep churn of stars and storylines. The league has evolved dramatically over that period, with offensive philosophy, quarterback usage and the spotlight economy around elite players reshaping how fans experience the sport. An MVP list from 2000 forward functions as an unofficial timeline of that evolution, whether it points back to eras dominated by certain positions, teams or schemes.

While the quiz format is light, the topic is not. MVP remains one of the league’s most consequential individual designations: it influences legacies, frames Hall of Fame arguments and becomes a defining reference point in contract conversations and marketing narratives. Even without getting into year-by-year winners, the central premise — 25 separate MVP seasons since 2000 — highlights just how many distinct campaigns have stood above the rest in the eyes of voters, and how quickly the league turns over from one defining star to the next.

For fans, the exercise doubles as a refresher course and a prompt for the next debate. The NFL’s MVP race resets every season, but it rarely starts from scratch; it builds on what came before, including the way prior winners shaped expectations for the players who followed. As the league heads into its next cycle of award talk, the quiz offers a timely reminder of what it takes to be remembered — and how hard it can be to recall every player who reached the sport’s most visible summit since 2000.With the NFL’s annual MVP debate already part of the league’s year-round ecosystem, Yahoo Sports is leaning into the enduring pull of the award with a new interactive challenge aimed at testing fans’ memory of recent pro football history.
