Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show at the 2026 Super Bowl, giving the NFL one of the biggest global music stars on the sport’s largest stage and underscoring the league’s continued push to make Super Bowl Sunday as much a worldwide entertainment event as it is a championship game. Charlie Puth is set to perform the national anthem, CBS Sports NFL reported.

The pairing signals an unmistakable emphasis on reach and mainstream appeal. Bad Bunny is a three-time Grammy Award winner and, according to CBS Sports NFL, the most-streamed artist in the world. For the NFL, that kind of footprint matters on a night that routinely draws massive audiences and dominates the broader cultural conversation well beyond football. For fans, it is another reminder that the Super Bowl experience is shaped not only by the matchup and commercials but also by the performance elements that frame the game and set its tone.

Bad Bunny’s selection continues the modern trend of the league leaning into halftime headliners with deep catalog recognition and a cross-generational fan base. His status as the most-streamed artist in the world positions the league to connect with international viewers and younger audiences who may engage with the Super Bowl first through its entertainment moments and then through the game itself. The halftime show, in particular, has become a centerpiece that can expand the event’s footprint far beyond traditional NFL demographics.

Puth’s national anthem assignment places a pop mainstay at the start of the night’s formalities, a spotlight role that routinely becomes one of the most discussed performances of the broadcast. While the anthem is typically brief compared to halftime, it carries outsized visibility and can set the emotional tenor for the evening before kickoff.

The NFL has increasingly treated Super Bowl week as a tentpole for both sports and entertainment programming, and these announcements provide an early look at how the league and its partners are building the event’s narrative months ahead of the game itself. The focus now shifts to the playoff race that will determine which two teams take the field — and how the league will continue rolling out the rest of the Super Bowl presentation leading into 2026.Bad Bunny will headline the halftime show at the 2026 Super Bowl, giving the NFL one of the biggest global music stars on the sport’s largest stage and underscoring the league’s continued push to make Super Bowl Sunday as much a worldwide entertainment event as it is a championship game.
