NFL commissioner Roger Goodell indicated the league’s recent overhaul of kickoffs may not be the last major adjustment to special teams, saying additional changes could be coming not only to kickoffs but also to punts. The comments signal the NFL is still searching for the right balance between safety and playmaking on some of the game’s most dangerous and most strategic snaps.

Goodell’s remarks, reported by Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk, come as the league continues to evaluate the early impact of its revised kickoff format. The NFL has spent years attempting to reduce high-speed collisions on kick returns while preserving the competitive element that can flip field position and change games. With Goodell openly discussing the possibility of more tweaks, it underscores that the league views the current rules as a work in progress rather than a finished product.

While Goodell did not lay out a specific proposal in the reports, the broad scope of his comments points to two areas that consistently sit at the center of league conversations: player safety and the overall quality of the play. Kickoffs have long carried heightened injury concerns because of long run-ups and open-field contact, and they also have been affected by strategic countermeasures that can reduce returns. The league’s willingness to continue revisiting the rules reflects the ongoing tension between reducing risk and maintaining a phase of the game that produces momentum-swinging returns, surprise onside attempts and critical late-game field position swings.

Goodell also raised the possibility of changes to punts, another special-teams play that can create similar collision risks during coverage and returns. Even without specifics, mentioning punts alongside kickoffs is notable because punts are central to weekly game management — a field-position tool that impacts defensive strategy, fourth-down decision-making and clock control. Any future adjustment could ripple through coaching approaches, roster construction and the value teams place on specialists and coverage players.

The next steps will be worth watching as the league gathers more data and feedback from clubs, coaches and the competition committee. With Goodell publicly leaving the door open to further changes, fans should expect special teams to remain a front-burner topic in league meetings, with potential rule refinements aimed at shaping how — and how often — returns happen while limiting the most hazardous contact in the game’s third phase.NFL commissioner Roger Goodell indicated the league’s recent overhaul of kickoffs may not be the last major adjustment to special teams, saying additional changes could be coming not only to kickoffs but also to punts.
