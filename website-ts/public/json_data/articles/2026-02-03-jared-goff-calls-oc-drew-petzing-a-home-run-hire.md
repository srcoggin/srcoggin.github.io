Jared Goff is treating Detroit’s latest offensive-coordinator change as a sign of confidence rather than instability, calling the hiring of Drew Petzing a “home run” as the Lions prepare for their third new playcaller in as many seasons in 2026.

The Lions’ ongoing coordinator churn could be framed as a potential hurdle for a veteran quarterback, but Goff does not see it that way. According to Pro Football Talk, Goff said the turnover is not a problem for him as he heads into another year of adjusting to a new offensive voice. In a league where continuity is often prized — especially on the offensive side of the ball — Goff’s response underscores how Detroit is trying to keep its competitive window open while adapting to inevitable staff movement.

Petzing’s arrival puts him in charge of an offense that has remained a central identity of the Lions’ rise in recent seasons, even as key coaching roles have changed. The headline from Pro Football Talk framed Goff’s endorsement as emphatic: the quarterback labeled Petzing a “home run hire,” an early public vote of confidence that matters for a unit preparing to install terminology, sequencing and game-planning rhythms under a new coordinator.

For Detroit, the stakes are more than cosmetic. NFL offenses are built on timing, communication and weekly adjustment, and coordinator turnover can threaten all three — particularly in the passing game, where a quarterback’s comfort with protections and route concepts is tested under pressure. Goff’s calm reaction signals a belief that the Lions can keep their offensive baseline intact even while the coaching staff evolves, and that Petzing can blend his own preferences with what the roster already does well.

The Lions entering 2026 with yet another new offensive coordinator also reflects a broader NFL reality: productive offenses tend to get their assistants noticed, creating frequent upward mobility and poaching. Detroit’s ability to sustain success through turnover has become a measuring stick for its organizational maturity, from coaching to scouting to quarterback leadership.

What comes next will be closely watched in training camp and early regular-season games as Petzing’s system becomes visible through personnel usage, tempo and third-down approach. If the Lions’ offense starts quickly, it will validate Goff’s “home run” assessment and suggest Detroit can withstand staff changes without losing momentum — a critical trait for teams with championship ambitions.Jared Goff is treating Detroit’s latest offensive-coordinator change as a sign of confidence rather than instability, calling the hiring of Drew Petzing a “home run” as the Lions prepare for their third new playcaller in as many seasons in 2026.
