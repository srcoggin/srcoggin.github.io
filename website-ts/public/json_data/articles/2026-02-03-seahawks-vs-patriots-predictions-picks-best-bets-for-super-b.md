The first betting markets and prediction models for Super Bowl 60 are already drilling down to a familiar postseason truth: the team that can dictate terms on the ground often dictates the game. Ahead of the Seattle Seahawks’ matchup with the New England Patriots on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, Yahoo Sports’ NFL coverage framed the contest through a clear expectation — that Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson will “dominate the backfield workload” and find success on the ground.

That projected usage is significant because it points to the kind of game New England appears intent on playing on the sport’s biggest stage: a run-centered approach that can control tempo, reduce risk and keep the opposing offense on the sideline. Stevenson’s anticipated role also underscores how the Patriots’ path to a title hinges on turning one of their most reliable offensive pieces into the focal point, particularly in a one-game championship setting where possession and field position can decide everything.

Stevenson has been a central figure in New England’s backfield in recent seasons, and Yahoo Sports’ best-bets framing suggests oddsmakers and analysts expect that trend to intensify rather than flatten in a Super Bowl environment. In a league that increasingly leans on spread concepts and explosive passing plays, a projection that a running back will carry a dominant share of the workload is a reminder that roster construction — and the ability to win in multiple ways — still matters most when the stakes peak.

For Seattle, the analysis sets up a straightforward strategic challenge: limit Stevenson early, avoid allowing the Patriots to stay on schedule and force New England into longer third downs. If the Patriots can run efficiently, they can shorten the game and keep the Seahawks from creating the kind of high-variance, quick-strike rhythm that often swings postseason matchups. The Yahoo Sports preview framing, centered on Stevenson’s expected success, also suggests that New England’s offensive identity for this game is not simply about balance, but about leverage — using the run game to make everything else easier.

Super Bowl 60, set for Feb. 8, will also serve as a snapshot of how both franchises have built their contenders. The Seahawks and Patriots are two of the league’s most recognizable brands, and a matchup between them immediately carries the weight of legacy, roster-building philosophy and postseason pressure.

As kickoff approaches, the spotlight will sharpen on one question with broad implications for NFL fans: whether Seattle can take away the Patriots’ most obvious path to controlling the game. If Stevenson does, as projected, “dominate the backfield workload” and deliver on the ground, it could define not only the matchup, but the blueprint for how New England intends to win a championship on football’s biggest Sunday.The first betting markets and prediction models for Super Bowl 60 are already drilling down to a familiar postseason truth: the team that can dictate terms on the ground often dictates the game.
