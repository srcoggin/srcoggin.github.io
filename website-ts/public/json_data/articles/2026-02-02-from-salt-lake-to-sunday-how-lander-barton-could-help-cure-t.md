The Dallas Cowboys have a familiar problem heading into draft season, and this time the solution could come from an unlikely pipeline that runs from Utah to the NFL: linebacker help. With the roster in flux at one of the defense’s most stressed positions, the Cowboys are expected to prioritize the second level during the NFL Draft, and Yahoo Sports NFL highlighted one name who could fit the bill — Lander Barton, a prospect whose path from Salt Lake City to Sundays has put him on the radar as a potential answer to Dallas’ linebacker woes.

Dallas’ need is straightforward. The Cowboys “are going to have to find linebacker help during the NFL Draft,” according to Yahoo Sports, a direct reflection of how central the position has become to making their defense function week to week. Linebackers are asked to clean up run fits, carry tight ends and backs in coverage, and communicate adjustments in space — all tasks that become even more demanding in a league increasingly built around pre-snap motion and quick-game passing concepts. When a team is thin or inconsistent at linebacker, the effects often cascade, stressing the defensive line’s gap integrity and exposing the secondary over the middle.

Barton’s appeal, as framed by Yahoo Sports, is rooted in both his background and his potential fit for a team searching for stability in the middle of the defense. The outlet’s focus on Barton underscores how the Cowboys’ draft board may extend beyond the most nationally familiar names, especially at a position where plug-and-play options can be scarce and development curves vary widely. For Dallas, identifying a linebacker who can contribute early — or at least provide a clear developmental track — would help address a roster pressure point that has lingered into the offseason.

The broader context is that the draft often becomes the most practical avenue for teams to repair holes at linebacker without committing major resources elsewhere. Dallas’ approach will be shaped by its overall roster construction and how it chooses to allocate draft capital, but the urgency at linebacker is evident in the way the position has become a focal point in draft-centered coverage. Yahoo Sports’ spotlight on Barton reflects the reality that teams frequently target athletic, high-upside defenders in the middle rounds, hoping to find value and long-term starters.

As the draft approaches, what to watch is whether Dallas’ front office signals an aggressive plan — addressing linebacker early — or opts to trust its evaluations deeper into the board, where prospects like Barton enter the conversation. Either way, the Cowboys’ ability to stabilize the linebacker group will matter not only to the defense’s weekly floor, but also to how far the team can realistically push in a postseason environment that punishes soft spots between the tackles and in the intermediate passing lanes.The Dallas Cowboys have a familiar problem heading into draft season, and this time the solution could come from an unlikely pipeline that runs from Utah to the NFL: linebacker help.
