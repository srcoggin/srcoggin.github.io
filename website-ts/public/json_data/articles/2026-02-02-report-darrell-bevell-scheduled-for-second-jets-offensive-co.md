Darrell Bevell is scheduled to get a second interview with the New York Jets for their offensive coordinator job, a sign the team is narrowing its search as it tries to reset an offense that has been a persistent flashpoint for the franchise. Pro Football Talk reported Bevell is among the candidates who will meet again with the Jets, a step that typically indicates a coach remains under serious consideration as a staff comes into focus.

The Jets’ offensive coordinator hire carries outsized importance in New York because it will shape not only the scheme and weekly game plans but also the organization’s broader identity after another turbulent season. A second interview suggests the Jets’ decision-makers want a deeper look at how a candidate would build the unit, staff it and fit within the team’s broader coaching structure. It also can provide a window into how the candidate would tailor an offense to the Jets’ personnel, including any decisions the club makes at quarterback and along the offensive line.

Bevell’s candidacy adds a veteran option to the mix as the Jets evaluate what kind of offense they want to run and how quickly they believe it can be installed. Second interviews often move beyond broad philosophical questions and into specifics: preferred terminology, practice structure, collaborative dynamics with the head coach, and how to maximize key players. The Jets’ willingness to bring Bevell back indicates he has cleared initial thresholds in those areas.

For fans, the news matters because the Jets’ offensive coordinator will be a central driver of any meaningful turnaround. Coordinators influence everything from tempo and play-calling tendencies to red-zone approach and third-down design — details that can swing close games and define a season. In a league increasingly shaped by offensive innovation and quarterback development, the Jets’ next coordinator will be under immediate scrutiny, particularly if the team is pairing the hire with major roster decisions on the offensive side of the ball.

The Jets’ process is still unfolding, and a second interview does not guarantee a hire. But it does place Bevell in a smaller tier of candidates being vetted at a more advanced stage. The next steps to watch will be whether additional finalists also receive follow-up meetings and how quickly the Jets move toward a decision that can set the direction of the offseason program and, ultimately, the franchise’s next attempt to build a consistent winner.Darrell Bevell is scheduled to get a second interview with the New York Jets for their offensive coordinator job, a sign the team is narrowing its search as it tries to reset an offense that has been a persistent flashpoint for the franchise.
