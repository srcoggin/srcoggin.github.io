The Pittsburgh Steelers are set to add another familiar NFL name to Mike Tomlin’s staff, with Yahoo Sports reporting the team plans to hire a former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman as a coach. Even in a division defined by continuity and long memories, the move stands out for the way it underscores Pittsburgh’s ongoing effort to refresh its coaching pipeline while staying rooted in AFC North football.

According to the report, the Steelers’ latest addition comes as the franchise continues to round out its coaching group ahead of the offseason program and, eventually, training camp. While the specific responsibilities of the former Bengals lineman were not detailed in the source material, the hire fits a common leaguewide trend: teams increasingly lean on former players — particularly those with recent experience in the division — to help teach technique, translate scheme details and connect with the locker room.

For Pittsburgh, the AFC North backdrop matters. The Steelers see Cincinnati twice every season, and the matchup has long been one of the league’s most physical rivalries. Adding a coach with direct playing experience in that environment carries built-in familiarity with the division’s expectations and the standard of play required along the line of scrimmage. It also aligns with the premium the Steelers have traditionally placed on defensive line development, where execution and cohesion are essential to stopping the run and generating pressure without compromising coverage structure.

The report also reflects a broader theme of the Steelers’ offseason: incremental but important staffing decisions that can have ripple effects when the games begin. Coaching hires below the coordinator level rarely dominate headlines, but they often shape the day-to-day work that determines whether a defense is sound in its fundamentals — particularly in tackling, run fits and pass-rush technique. Those details can swing close games in a division where margins are tight and familiarity between opponents is high.

With the hiring expected to proceed, the next steps will be clarifying the coach’s exact role and how he fits into Tomlin’s staff structure as Pittsburgh continues preparing for 2026. The offseason remains the Steelers’ window to build continuity and sharpen the details that tend to decide AFC North games, and another coaching addition — especially one with Cincinnati ties — only adds to the intrigue of what the staff will look like when the team hits the practice field.The Pittsburgh Steelers are set to add another familiar NFL name to Mike Tomlin’s staff, with Yahoo Sports reporting the team plans to hire a former Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman as a coach.
