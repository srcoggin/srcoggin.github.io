Jesse Minter’s first staff in Baltimore is beginning to take shape, and the Ravens are expected to land a notable addition on the offensive side. Baltimore is expected to hire Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle, 29, to fill the same role with the Ravens, according to CBS Sports NFL, a move that would give the new head coach a young play-caller with recent coordinator experience as he begins setting his identity with the franchise.

CBS Sports reported Minter is “closing in on a big addition to his staff,” with Doyle emerging as the expected hire. While the Ravens’ organizational foundation has long been rooted in defense, the decision to bring in an offensive coordinator with a title and recent responsibility signals an emphasis on quickly stabilizing and modernizing the attack under a first-year head coach.

Doyle’s age stands out even in a league that has increasingly fast-tracked younger coaches into prominent roles. At 29, he would arrive in Baltimore with the cachet of having already worn the offensive coordinator label in Chicago. For the Ravens, that combination of youth and experience fits a broader NFL trend that prioritizes adaptability, communication and scheme flexibility — particularly in an era when offenses are increasingly asked to respond weekly to changing defensive structures.

For Chicago, the expected move would represent another significant change in an offensive staff that has been in flux. Coordinator departures often ripple beyond play design, affecting terminology, weekly preparation and player development — particularly for quarterbacks and skill players — and would leave the Bears needing to replace a key voice in their offensive planning.

In Baltimore, the anticipated pairing of Minter and Doyle offers a clearer picture of how the new coach intends to staff his operation. Hiring an offensive coordinator early in a regime is typically among the most consequential decisions a head coach makes, shaping everything from quarterback development to fourth-down decision-making tendencies and game-day rhythm. The Ravens’ decision to target Doyle suggests Minter is prioritizing a coordinator with recent experience directing an offense at the NFL level, even if Doyle remains early in his career.

The next steps will be how quickly Baltimore finalizes the hire and what other staff decisions follow around Doyle. Once in place, the coordinator’s primary task will be to install systems and language ahead of the offseason program, aligning scheme with personnel and setting the tone for how the Ravens will operate under Minter. For fans, the significance is straightforward: coordinator choices often foreshadow a team’s weekly personality, and this one could help define what Baltimore’s offense looks like in the post-transition era.Jesse Minter’s first staff in Baltimore is beginning to take shape, and the Ravens are expected to land a notable addition on the offensive side.
