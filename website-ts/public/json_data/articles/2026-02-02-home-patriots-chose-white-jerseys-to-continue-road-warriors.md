The New England Patriots will wear white jerseys in Super Bowl LX even though they are designated as the home team, a small but telling decision that underscores how the franchise wants to frame its latest championship run — as one built on traveling well and thriving outside Foxborough.

Pro Football Talk reported the Patriots, listed as the “home” team for the league’s championship game, chose to wear white to keep what the outlet described as a “Road Warriors” vibe. In the NFL’s Super Bowl format, the home designation does not correspond to venue advantage the way it does during the regular season and playoffs. Instead, it primarily affects administrative details such as which sideline a team occupies and, notably, which jersey it wears. Home teams typically wear their darker colors, but the Patriots opted for white despite having the choice.

That choice matters in a league where preparation often extends into routine and symbolism. Teams can treat uniform selections as a way to reinforce messaging internally — a reminder of what has carried them through a season — and externally as a snapshot of identity on the sport’s biggest stage. For a Patriots team that is technically “home” only on paper in Super Bowl LX, wearing white serves as a visual cue that the group is leaning into the idea it has been forged away from familiar comforts.

The decision also highlights the quirks of the Super Bowl’s rotating home-team assignment, which is based on conference rotation rather than record or seeding. While home-field advantage is a major currency in the postseason, the Super Bowl’s neutral-site setting compresses those edges. Details like jersey choice become one of the few levers a team can pull to create a sense of continuity from what worked previously.

For fans, the uniform call is not just a wardrobe note. It is a signpost for how the Patriots want this game to feel — a continuation of the approach that got them here rather than a reset because the calendar says “Super Bowl” and the team is labeled “home.” It can also influence the game’s optics and the way matchups are presented, from broadcast visuals to sideline dynamics.

As kickoff approaches, the more meaningful questions will revolve around execution rather than aesthetics, but the Patriots’ preference is clear: even as the designated home team, New England plans to look and operate like a visitor. In a single-game championship, teams search for any edge in focus and familiarity, and the Patriots are signaling they intend to carry their road mindset all the way through Super Bowl LX.The New England Patriots will wear white jerseys in Super Bowl LX even though they are designated as the home team, a small but telling decision that underscores how the franchise wants to frame its latest championship run — as one built on traveling well and thriving outside Foxborough.
