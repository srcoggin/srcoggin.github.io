NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell used his annual Super Bowl week press conference to address a slate of off-field and football matters that continue to reverberate around the league, ranging from New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the absence of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick from the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s most recent class.

Goodell’s session, a Super Bowl tradition that often functions as a state-of-the-league checkpoint, landed with added significance this year as the NFL balances the sport’s on-field momentum with heightened scrutiny on governance, accountability and legacy issues. The commissioner “tackled a variety of topics” in a wide-ranging appearance, according to CBS Sports NFL, with questions reflecting both immediate headlines and long-running debates among fans and stakeholders.

One of the prominent subjects was Tisch, a high-profile owner within one of the league’s flagship franchises. The Giants’ ownership is among the NFL’s most visible, and any controversy touching the organization can quickly become a leaguewide issue given the team’s market, history and profile. Goodell addressed the matter of Tisch’s ties to Epstein, a topic that has drawn attention beyond football and underscores how closely the NFL’s business leaders can be examined during moments of public scrutiny. Super Bowl week, with its unusually bright spotlight, frequently becomes the venue where the league is pressed for clarity on sensitive issues involving owners and the league’s standards.

Goodell also weighed in on the Hall of Fame discussion surrounding Belichick, one of the most influential coaches of the modern era and a central figure in the league’s competitive history. CBS Sports noted Goodell addressed Belichick’s “HOF snub,” a point that has fueled conversation among fans because the Hall of Fame is both an honor roll and a key piece of how the league tells its story. When a major figure is not included, the decision resonates well beyond one voting cycle, affecting how careers are framed and debated.

The commissioner’s broad approach to topics during the press conference reflects the NFL’s reality in February: Even as the Super Bowl provides the season’s culminating spectacle, the league is simultaneously managing reputational questions and legacy judgments that shape how fans experience the sport year-round.

With the offseason set to accelerate after the Super Bowl, Goodell’s comments offered a reminder that the league’s biggest week is also its most accountable one. For NFL fans, what to watch next is whether these conversations prompt further action or clarification from the league and its clubs — and how the league’s most powerful decision-makers navigate scrutiny that is increasingly as relentless as the sport itself.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell used his annual Super Bowl week press conference to address a slate of off-field and football matters that continue to reverberate around the league, ranging from New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the absence of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick from the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s most recent class.
