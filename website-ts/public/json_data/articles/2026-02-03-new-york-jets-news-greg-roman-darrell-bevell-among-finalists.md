The New York Jets’ search for an offensive coordinator has narrowed, with Greg Roman and Darrell Bevell among the finalists for the job, according to a roundup from Yahoo Sports NFL. The decision carries major weight for a franchise trying to stabilize an offense that has struggled for consistency, because the next coordinator will shape the Jets’ identity, staffing and weekly game plans heading into a pivotal offseason.

Yahoo Sports’ report framed Roman and Bevell as key names still in the mix as the Jets work through their hiring process. The coordinator search is one of the most consequential moves the organization can make between seasons, particularly for a team trying to build an offense that can function efficiently across an entire schedule. The Jets’ next coordinator will be tasked with installing terminology, designing the passing and running games, coordinating with position coaches and meshing the system with the personnel already under contract and any additions made in free agency and the draft.

Roman is widely known around the league for run-focused offenses and for adapting systems to emphasize quarterback mobility and the ground game. Bevell has extensive NFL experience calling plays and working on offensive staffs. For the Jets, finalists with long track records underscore how critical the hire is as the club seeks clarity and continuity on that side of the ball. A coordinator’s philosophy can ripple through every other roster decision — from the type of offensive linemen a team targets, to the skill sets prioritized at quarterback, receiver and running back, to how quickly younger players are expected to contribute.

The Jets’ offense has been under a bright spotlight in recent seasons, and the coordinator position often becomes a measuring stick for organizational direction. The hiring process also serves as a signal to players and prospective additions about what kind of scheme and coaching approach will be in place. That matters in a league where marginal changes in efficiency — on third down, in the red zone, or in protecting the football — can swing close games over the course of a season.

For now, the Jets continue to move through the finalist stage with Roman and Bevell among the prominent candidates highlighted by Yahoo Sports. The next steps to watch are whether the team completes additional interviews, how quickly it moves toward a decision and how the eventual hire fills out the rest of the offensive staff. The choice will set the tone for the offseason program and, ultimately, for how the Jets intend to score points and win games in the fall.The New York Jets’ search for an offensive coordinator has narrowed, with Greg Roman and Darrell Bevell among the finalists for the job, according to a roundup from Yahoo Sports NFL.
