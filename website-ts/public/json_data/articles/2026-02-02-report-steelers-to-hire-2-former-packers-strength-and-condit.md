The Pittsburgh Steelers continued a busy day of coaching-staff construction Sunday, with Yahoo Sports reporting the franchise is set to hire two former Green Bay Packers strength and conditioning coaches. The move signals an emphasis on reshaping the team’s performance and sports-science infrastructure as Pittsburgh tweaks its operation behind the scenes entering the 2026 offseason.

According to Yahoo Sports NFL, the Steelers’ latest additions come from Green Bay’s strength and conditioning ranks, further adding to a Sunday that featured notable staffing activity. While on-field coordinators and position coaches typically draw the most attention, strength and conditioning hires can have wide-ranging impact on a roster over the long arc of an NFL season, influencing availability, late-season stamina and the daily routine that governs how players build and maintain their bodies.

In modern NFL buildings, the strength and conditioning department has also become increasingly intertwined with sports medicine, workload management and return-to-play processes. That makes the Steelers’ reported decision to bring in multiple former Packers coaches particularly significant, suggesting Pittsburgh is not simply filling a vacancy but potentially restructuring how it approaches training and performance. Fans often see the effects in less visible ways — who is able to practice consistently, how quickly players return from soft-tissue injuries and whether a team looks fresh or worn down late in the year.

The Packers, one of the league’s most stable organizations, have long been regarded as a franchise with continuity in football operations. Hiring from that pipeline can be attractive for teams seeking proven systems and familiar methods, especially when attempting to modernize performance programs without reinventing them entirely.

The report also underscores how active Pittsburgh has been in building out its staff. Coaching news is not limited to play-callers; it extends to the support structure that underpins weekly preparation. For a Steelers franchise that prides itself on physicality, investing in strength and conditioning is closely tied to identity as well as results.

What comes next will be how these hires fit into the Steelers’ broader offseason plan and whether additional changes follow in other performance-related areas. With offseason workouts, training camp planning and individualized player programs all shaped well before the first practice, the immediate watch point is how Pittsburgh integrates the incoming coaches and whether the organization signals a broader shift in how it develops durability and performance over the length of the season.The Pittsburgh Steelers continued a busy day of coaching-staff construction Sunday, with Yahoo Sports reporting the franchise is set to hire two former Green Bay Packers strength and conditioning coaches.
