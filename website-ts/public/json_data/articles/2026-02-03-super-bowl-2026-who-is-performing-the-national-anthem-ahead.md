With Super Bowl LX set to bring the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots together on the sport’s biggest stage, the league’s pregame spotlight is also coming into focus. CBS Sports NFL previewed the national anthem plans for the Santa Clara crowd, a centerpiece moment that typically frames the spectacle before kickoff and often becomes one of the most talked-about performances of the night.

CBS Sports’ look at the anthem ahead of Seahawks vs. Patriots in Super Bowl LX underscores how the NFL’s pregame presentation has become an event within the event, especially for fans who tune in hours before the opening whistle. The national anthem — staged in front of a global audience and delivered under the pressure of live television and the largest single-game crowd of the season — remains a ritual that signals the official start of Super Bowl Sunday. The outlet’s preview focuses on identifying who will perform for those in attendance in Santa Clara, where the league’s championship game is scheduled to be played.

The matchup itself carries built-in intrigue for even casual fans. Seattle and New England are two of the NFL’s most recognizable franchises of the 21st century, each defined by stretches of sustained success and iconic postseason moments. Their presence in Super Bowl LX ensures the broadcast will draw heightened attention not only to the game but to everything surrounding it — from introductions and halftime to the anthem, which historically has produced viral moments, betting interest and lengthy postgame discussion.

CBS Sports framed the anthem selection as part of the broader entertainment package that helps separate the Super Bowl from every other game on the calendar. While the league’s championship is ultimately decided between the lines, the NFL has long leaned into the cultural reach of Super Bowl week — a platform where musical performances can resonate well beyond football fans and where a few minutes of pregame ceremony can become a defining snapshot of the night.

For Seahawks and Patriots fans, the anthem performer matters in a practical way, too: It marks the final quiet moment before the game’s tension takes over. It also serves as the final stop in a pregame buildup that can affect how players and coaches manage routines, timing and focus in the final minutes before kickoff.

As Super Bowl LX approaches, attention will continue to build around every piece of the presentation in Santa Clara — including the anthem, which CBS Sports highlighted as a key part of the evening’s staging. Once that performance ends, the storyline shifts quickly to what matters most: how Seattle and New England handle the moment, the pressure and each other, with a championship and legacy on the line.With Super Bowl LX set to bring the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots together on the sport’s biggest stage, the league’s pregame spotlight is also coming into focus.
