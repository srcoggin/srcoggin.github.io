The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots arrived in the Bay Area on Sunday, turning the page from two weeks of buildup to the final week of preparation ahead of Super Bowl LX. With the NFL’s biggest game now on the doorstep, the travel day served as the first tangible milestone of Super Bowl week — a shift from planning and projection to the daily routine that will lead directly to kickoff.

Both teams flew in Sunday, according to Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk, setting up what is typically the most choreographed stretch of the season. The timing matters: arriving a week out allows organizations to establish their practice schedule, get settled in new surroundings and manage the inevitable obligations that come with playing on the sport’s largest stage.

For the Seahawks and Patriots, the move to the Bay Area underscores the scale of the moment. The Super Bowl is no longer a distant event on a calendar; it is now the team hotel, the meeting rooms, the practice field and the full attention of a national media pack. Every decision — from how coaches structure the week to how players handle downtime — becomes part of the competitive equation. Even in an era when travel is routine in the NFL, Super Bowl week is its own test of focus and discipline.

Sunday’s arrival also signals the start of the final, most public phase of preparations. The on-field work is largely about sharpening rather than installing, with coaches emphasizing situational football and communication. The off-field side can be just as demanding, with media sessions and league events layered into the week. Navigating those distractions has long been considered a differentiator between teams that simply reach the Super Bowl and those that play their best once they get there.

The Seahawks and Patriots now have a defined runway to game day, with the Bay Area serving as the backdrop for the final practices and planning meetings. The teams’ travel marks the beginning of the last stretch in what has already been an extended postseason calendar, and it sets the scene for a week in which every detail — health, rhythm and mental sharpness — will be scrutinized.

What to watch next is how each team settles into its routine after Sunday’s flight, and whether the transition into Super Bowl week brings a calm, businesslike feel or the kind of early turbulence that can ripple into Sunday. With both clubs now on site, the countdown to Super Bowl LX has entered its final, unmistakable phase.The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots arrived in the Bay Area on Sunday, turning the page from two weeks of buildup to the final week of preparation ahead of Super Bowl LX.
