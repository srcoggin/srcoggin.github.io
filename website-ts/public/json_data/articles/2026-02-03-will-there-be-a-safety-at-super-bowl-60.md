With Super Bowl 60 set for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, the usual matchup debates are sharing space with a quieter, numbers-driven question that can swing both betting markets and game strategy: Will there be a safety? Yahoo Sports NFL framed the issue by examining historical Super Bowl data and translating it into odds for the NFL’s rarest scoring play, a two-point event that can flip momentum, reshape late-game math and leave a permanent imprint on the sport’s biggest stage.

A safety is deceptively simple in the rule book — the offense is tackled in its own end zone or otherwise commits a dead-ball foul there — but it is uncommon because it requires an extreme convergence of field position, protection breakdown and defensive pressure. In the Super Bowl, where teams tend to prioritize ball security and avoid high-risk decisions deep in their own territory, that convergence is even harder to find. That is why Yahoo Sports leaned on the league’s historical record from past Super Bowls to frame the likelihood for Super Bowl 60, emphasizing that history can inform expectations even if it cannot predict the specific play that produces one.

The stakes are larger than a novelty. Safeties instantly create points without requiring an offensive drive, and they also hand the scoring team the ball again via a free kick, making the swing potentially more dramatic than the two points alone. In a game often decided by a single possession, a safety can force coaching staffs to reconsider fourth-down choices, punt tactics and how conservative to be when backed up near the goal line. Field position becomes more than a chess match; it becomes a scoreboard threat.

Yahoo Sports’ focus on odds also underscores why the safety question resurfaces every February: It sits at the intersection of history, probability and the Super Bowl’s unique intensity. Fans remember that even one unusual play can define a championship, and the safety is among the most unusual. While scoring has evolved across eras and offenses have become more aggressive, the circumstances that create safeties remain situational and often sudden, making them difficult to anticipate.

As kickoff approaches for Super Bowl 60, the most telling sequences to watch may not come in the red zone but in the shadow of each goal line — a backed-up offense after a punt pinned inside the 10, a quarterback forced to retreat under pressure, or a mishandled snap that turns a routine play into panic. Yahoo Sports’ historical examination suggests the right way to view the safety is not as a prediction but as a reminder: On the NFL’s biggest Sunday, even the rarest outcomes are still on the table.With Super Bowl 60 set for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, the usual matchup debates are sharing space with a quieter, numbers-driven question that can swing both betting markets and game strategy: Will there be a safety?
