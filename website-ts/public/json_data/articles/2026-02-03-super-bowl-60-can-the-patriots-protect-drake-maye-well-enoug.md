Super Bowl LX may still be months away, but an early matchup lens is already narrowing to one essential question: Can New England keep rookie quarterback Drake Maye upright long enough to outduel Seattle’s Sam Darnold on the sport’s biggest stage?

CBS Sports NFL framed its early look at a potential Patriots-Seahawks championship meeting around protection and pressure, a familiar Super Bowl equation that often decides titles as much as star power does. In that view, the Patriots’ ability to protect Maye stands out as the central swing factor against a Seattle team led by Darnold, a quarterback whose career has been defined by opportunity, reinvention and the constant need to win from the pocket.

The storyline carries weight beyond a single game projection because it speaks to the roster-building challenge New England faces with a young quarterback. Maye represents the franchise’s next era at the position, and the Super Bowl conversation — however early — underscores how quickly a rookie QB’s ceiling can become a team’s mandate. For the Patriots, that mandate is straightforward: build an offense that can function under postseason pressure and hold up when elite defenses inevitably turn the night into a test of protection rules, communication and toughness.

CBS Sports’ early breakdown included picks and odds and highlighted “key matchup edges,” with the most immediate edge tied to whether New England’s offensive front can neutralize Seattle’s pass rush and keep Maye on schedule. That matters because postseason football, and especially the Super Bowl, tends to punish teams that cannot consistently protect the quarterback. Even the best play designs shrink when the pocket collapses, and rookie passers are often the first to feel that squeeze.

On the other sideline, Darnold’s presence as Seattle’s quarterback adds a layer of intrigue to any Patriots-Seahawks forecast. It is a pairing that would pit a quarterback starting the newest chapter of his NFL résumé against one beginning his first as the face of a new franchise. In a game likely to feature high leverage situations, the team better able to avoid negative plays — sacks, hurried throws and drive-killing pressure — could tilt the outcome.

For NFL fans, the significance is twofold: it is a potential Super Bowl rematch setting for two storied franchises, and it is a snapshot of how quickly the league turns to the next quarterback debate. The closer Super Bowl LX gets, the more the conversation will sharpen around the same point CBS Sports raised now — not just who has the better quarterback, but which team can protect him when it matters most.Super Bowl LX may still be months away, but an early matchup lens is already narrowing to one essential question: Can New England keep rookie quarterback Drake Maye upright long enough to outduel Seattle’s Sam Darnold on the sport’s biggest stage?
