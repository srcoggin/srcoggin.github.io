The NFL is set to break new ground in 2026, with the league’s first regular-season game in France expected to feature the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints in Paris on Oct. 25, according to reports from Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk. The matchup carries added significance because it is slated to be a Saints “home” game, a long-planned international date that has been in the works for years as the league continues to expand its footprint in Europe.

The reports indicate New Orleans will give up a home date to stage the game in Paris, a notable concession even in an era when international games have become routine. For the Saints, that designation reinforces the idea that this is not simply another neutral-site showcase but a marquee event tied to a specific franchise, similar to how certain teams have been regularly linked to international markets in other parts of Europe. For Cleveland, the game represents a rare opportunity to be part of an inaugural NFL event on a new stage.

While the league has played regular-season games in multiple international locations over the past two decades, the move to France marks a fresh step in the NFL’s steady push to turn its overseas series from a novelty into a pillar of the schedule. Paris adds another major European capital to the league’s rotation and signals a continued willingness to place meaningful games — not exhibitions — in new markets. That matters for fans because the NFL’s international plan influences everything from scheduling quirks and travel demands to the broader commercial growth that can shape future events and team exposure.

The timing also underscores how far in advance the NFL and host organizations must work to pull off a regular-season game abroad. A date as specific as Oct. 25 suggests planning is already far along, even with the 2026 schedule itself not yet publicly finalized. Positioning the event in late October fits the window the league has often used for international contests, though the reports did not provide additional details on venue, kickoff time or surrounding events.

For now, what to watch is how the NFL frames Paris within its international strategy and how the Saints and Browns prepare for the logistical challenges that come with a transatlantic game that counts in the standings. If the reports prove accurate, the Browns-Saints matchup will be more than a single Sunday on the calendar — it will be a marker of the NFL’s next step in global expansion.The NFL is set to break new ground in 2026, with the league’s first regular-season game in France expected to feature the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints in Paris on Oct. 25, according to reports from Yahoo Sports NFL and Pro Football Talk.
