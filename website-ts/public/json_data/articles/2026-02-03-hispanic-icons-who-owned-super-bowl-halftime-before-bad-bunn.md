As the NFL’s biggest stage continues to evolve beyond football, ESPN’s latest look at Super Bowl halftime history underscores a through line that predates any current pop-culture buzz: Hispanic artists have long helped define what the league’s showcase looks and sounds like, shaping the entertainment identity of Super Bowl Sunday in ways that resonate far beyond the final score.

In its feature, ESPN highlighted the “wide array of Hispanic superstars” who have taken center stage at halftime, framing their impact as a foundation for the modern era of star-driven performances. The network pointed specifically to artists ranging “from Bruno Mars to Gloria Estefan,” pointing to a lineage of headline names who brought their catalogs and cultural influence to a broadcast watched by millions. The framing — “Hispanic icons who owned Super Bowl halftime before Bad Bunny” — situates today’s discussions about who might be next as part of a longer story, one in which Hispanic music’s crossover appeal and global reach have already helped set the template for how the league packages its premier event.

While the Super Bowl remains a championship game with legacies and dynasties at stake, the halftime show has become an extension of the NFL’s brand — a cultural tentpole designed to keep casual viewers engaged and to broaden the event’s audience. ESPN’s reflection on “top performances” serves as a reminder that the league’s entertainment ambitions have repeatedly leaned on Hispanic talent capable of spanning genres and generations. For fans, the halftime show is more than a break between the second and third quarters; it is often the most discussed nonfootball element of the day, a magnet for viewers who might not otherwise be tuned in strictly for the matchup.

The attention to figures such as Mars and Estefan also highlights how the halftime stage has historically rewarded performers with the kind of mass recognition that fits the NFL’s global push. The Super Bowl’s TV footprint makes it a rare platform where an artist’s back catalog can be reintroduced to longtime listeners while being discovered by younger audiences at the same time — a dynamic that matters for the league as it competes for attention in an increasingly fragmented sports and entertainment landscape.

Looking ahead, ESPN’s framing suggests that future halftime speculation will continue to be informed by what has worked before: artists with broad appeal, a deep roster of recognizable hits and the capacity to turn a short set into a stadium-scale moment. For NFL fans, the significance is clear — the halftime show is not a side note but a key part of what makes Super Bowl Sunday the league’s most powerful annual statement, and Hispanic stars have already been central to writing that script.As the NFL’s biggest stage continues to evolve beyond football, ESPN’s latest look at Super Bowl halftime history underscores a through line that predates any current pop-culture buzz: Hispanic artists have long helped define what the league’s showcase looks and sounds like, shaping the entertainment identity of Super Bowl Sunday in ways that resonate far beyond the final score.
