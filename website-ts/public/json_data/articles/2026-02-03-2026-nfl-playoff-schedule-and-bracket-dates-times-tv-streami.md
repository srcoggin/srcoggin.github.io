The NFL’s road to the Super Bowl is officially mapped out, with CBS Sports publishing the full 2026 playoff schedule and bracket — including dates, times and how to watch every postseason game. For fans, it is the clearest signal that the league’s stretch run will soon give way to a single-elimination tournament that defines careers, shapes legacies and determines the next champion.

According to CBS Sports’ NFL coverage, the schedule includes every playoff round, from the opening weekend through Super Bowl Sunday, with accompanying TV and streaming information for each matchup. The release matters because the NFL postseason is as much a logistical event as it is a sporting one: kick times influence travel and recovery, broadcast windows determine national exposure, and the bracket format frames the path for teams that earn byes or fight through the early rounds.

The modern NFL playoffs are built around a bracket that rewards regular-season performance. The league’s best teams earn home-field advantage and, at the top seed, a bye week that can provide a crucial health and preparation edge. Meanwhile, lower-seeded qualifiers face immediate elimination, where a single turnover or special-teams swing can flip a season. CBS Sports’ schedule presentation underscores the “when” and “where” of that gauntlet, giving teams and fans a firm calendar for planning — and creating the fixed landmarks that will shape the league’s late-season drama.

The viewing information attached to each game is also central to how the NFL has evolved. With games spread across multiple broadcast partners and streaming options, the postseason has become a multi-platform showcase as much as a traditional TV event. CBS Sports’ schedule and bracket package aims to simplify that landscape by listing the dates, times, TV channels and streaming availability for every playoff contest, including the Super Bowl.

For readers less familiar with the format, the NFL postseason progresses through successive rounds until only two teams remain, meeting in the Super Bowl — the league’s championship game and its biggest global stage. The schedule’s release serves as a reminder that the margin for error shrinks dramatically in January, when weekly matchups become do-or-die and coaching decisions, injury management and late-game execution are amplified.

The next checkpoint for fans is watching how the regular-season race shapes the bracket that will slot into CBS Sports’ posted calendar. The matchups are not set yet, but the structure is, and the timetable is now public — turning the final weeks of the season into a sprint toward specific windows, specific stages and, ultimately, the Super Bowl.The NFL’s road to the Super Bowl is officially mapped out, with CBS Sports publishing the full 2026 playoff schedule and bracket — including dates, times and how to watch every postseason game.
