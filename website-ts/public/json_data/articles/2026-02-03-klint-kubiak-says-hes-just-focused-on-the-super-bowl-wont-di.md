Klint Kubiak did little to cool the leaguewide expectation that he will be the Raiders’ next head coach, but he also did not offer anything that could be construed as confirmation as he prepared for the biggest game of his career. Speaking this week in Super Bowl build-up, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator said he is focused on the Super Bowl and would not discuss any potential coaching job with Las Vegas, according to Pro Football Talk.

The comments came as Kubiak’s name continues to circulate as the clear favorite to lead the Raiders after Super Bowl LX, a situation that has put a spotlight on the increasingly common NFL reality: coaching futures can be decided while a coordinator is still working through the final weeks of a championship run. With the Raiders searching for stability and an identity on offense, Kubiak’s expected move has become one of the most closely watched storylines surrounding the league’s annual coaching carousel.

Kubiak’s approach — keeping the conversation centered on the Super Bowl — fits the traditional posture of assistants on the sport’s biggest stage, particularly when job speculation could become a distraction for players and staff. Pro Football Talk reported that Kubiak “says he’s just focused on the Super Bowl” and “won’t discuss coaching Raiders,” even as he is “widely expected to become the next head coach of the Raiders after Super Bowl LX.”

For the Raiders, the stakes of the hire are obvious. A head coach selection sets the franchise’s roster-building timeline, dictates the type of quarterback it will prioritize, and shapes the schemes that will determine which current players fit — and which may not. It also affects the team’s ability to attract assistants and align the front office and coaching staff around a shared plan, something that becomes more complicated the longer the position remains open.

For Seahawks fans and the organization, Kubiak’s looming departure — if and when it becomes official — would mean another major change on the offensive side of the ball, potentially impacting continuity for a unit that would have to adapt again in 2026. Even without public comment from Kubiak on the Raiders, the expectation of a post-Super Bowl move raises questions about how Seattle would respond, and how quickly it could pivot to fill a coordinator role if Las Vegas completes the hire soon after the season’s final game.

Until Super Bowl LX is played, the situation is likely to remain in holding pattern publicly. What happens next depends on timing: if Kubiak’s expected move to Las Vegas materializes after the game, the Raiders would be positioned to turn quickly to building out a staff and setting the direction for the offseason, while the Seahawks would face another significant decision on offense in the wake of a title-week run.Klint Kubiak did little to cool the leaguewide expectation that he will be the Raiders’ next head coach, but he also did not offer anything that could be construed as confirmation as he prepared for the biggest game of his career.
