The Seahawks’ defense spent the 2025 season turning opponents into afterthoughts, allowing the fewest points in the NFL and powering Seattle to the top seed in the NFC. That résumé naturally rekindled one of the most familiar debates around the franchise: whether this group belongs in the same conversation as the “Legion of Boom,” the era-defining unit that set the standard for defense in Seattle. Safety Julian Love is not ducking the comparison — but he is drawing a clear line between inspiration and imitation.

Love acknowledged that the current Seahawks take motivation from the organization’s most famous defensive identity, while stressing that the present group is building something distinct. “We take inspiration from the Legion of Boom, but we’re not them,” Love said, according to Pro Football Talk. The message reflects a locker room intent on appreciating the past without letting it dictate the present, even as national attention builds around a defense that led the league in points allowed.

The comparisons were hard to avoid given the stakes and the results. Seattle’s 2025 performance wasn’t simply “good”; it produced tangible outcomes in the standings, with the Seahawks finishing atop the NFC. In a league increasingly defined by spacing, speed and offensive innovation, a points-allowed crown remains the cleanest measure of weekly dominance. It also tends to travel well into January, when possessions tighten and one or two stops can decide postseason games.

For long-time Seahawks fans, that reality stirs memories of the “Legion of Boom,” the nickname attached to the franchise’s previous golden defensive age. That group became synonymous with physical coverage, communication and swagger — a cultural touchstone as much as a scheme. Love’s framing matters because it sets expectations: Seattle’s current defense wants to be judged on its own terms rather than forced into a nostalgia contest.

The distinction also underscores a broader point about modern team-building. Even when a defense reaches the top of the statistical mountain, repeating that feat is difficult, and comparisons to a celebrated predecessor can become a distraction. Love’s comments signaled an awareness of that pressure and a desire to keep the focus on what the 2025 group has already proven — the ability to limit points and, in doing so, put its team in position to chase the season’s biggest goals.

What comes next will determine how this unit is ultimately remembered. Leading the NFL in points allowed and finishing first in the NFC created an unmistakable standard. The Seahawks now enter the next stage with heightened scrutiny, and the defense will be measured not only by how it plays, but by whether it can sustain the edge that separated it from the league in 2025.The Seahawks’ defense spent the 2025 season turning opponents into afterthoughts, allowing the fewest points in the NFL and powering Seattle to the top seed in the NFC.
